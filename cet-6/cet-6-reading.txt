A consistent approach is pivotal to successfully teaching a son or daughter right from wrong when punishing them. It prevents small misdeeds and poor conduct from tunung into greater misdeeds. You have to remain unwavering and mean it when you ask them, "Switch off your computer now”or “no dessert after dinner because you didn't touch your dinnet”.A consistent approach shows your son or daughter there are express effects for misdeeds and improper or unsatisfactory deeds or manners.Displaying a lack of consistency when purushing makes you directly accountable for your children's misdeeds and wiU not teach them how to be liable for their exploitsIt's also necessary that each partner is consistent with the discipline.If one parent is firm and the other is too forgiving, the son or daugh ter will key into that and attempt to manipulate the position to his or her dvantage. Parents must be in agreement on disciplinary code beforehand and make a commitment to each other to be consistent in carrying out and following through with the consequences. This can be especially dimcult if the child's parents are divorced or separated. (1) Though you are not living together, it's crucial that both parents have a united ground. (2) Openly and honestly agree these parameters with your former spouse and your son or daughter in advance, so that if any disciplinary action is called for, the effect of such misdeeds are fully realizedin adv:ince.Any disagreements between parents should be debated when the childis not present.Being consistent refers to being resolute, even when doing so is really demanding or gruelling. (3) It can someti mes be diffcults to arrive home after a lon8 day at work only to find a challenging evening of parenting in store for you.Your son or daughter will consistently probe the parameters and push the envelope' with you to see if there's any play in those consequences. By being resolute you are establishing there is not and that you demand them to do nothing less than assume the burden for their deeds.

当你因自己的儿子或女儿做了错事而惩罚他们时，前后一致的教育途径是至关重要的，它能预防小错变大。但是你一定要保持坚定，即当你对他们说：“现在，关了你的电脑竹或者“因为你没碰晚餐，饭后不许吃甜点”时，要让孩子觉得你不是闹着玩的前后一致的教育之道会让你的儿子或女儿知道，在他们做了错事，做了不适当的举止或不令人满意的行为之后，你会立刻有相应的反应。如果你教育孩子时缺乏前后一致的态度，你要直接为你孩子的错误行为负责，同时，你也无法教会他们如何为自己的行为负责。父母对规矩的态度保持一致也是十分必要的。如果父母中的一位很坚定而另一个太过宽容，儿子或女儿会钻此空子并试图利用这种优势加以操纵。父母必须事先对规矩达成一致，并相互承诺在实行时也步调相同，将相应的惩治结果实行到底。这实施起来对于离异的父母而言尤其困难。 (1)虽然你们不住在一起，但是父母间口径一致是十分关键的。(2)事先就此直接并诚实地与你的前任配偶达成一致，并告知你们的儿子或女儿，_旦他们做了破坏规矩的行为，惩治的效果就能充分实现。父母间任何的意见相左必须在孩子不在场时加以讨论。前后一致意味着要有决心，即使做起来非常费心、劳累。(3)有时这真的很困难：劳累了．一天回到家中，发现在家中，等待着你的是挑战――教育孩子。你的儿子或女儿会不停地探视惩罚的界限，想从你这里知道与此有关的事项，来看看做了这些事会有什么结果。有坚定的决心，你会让他们知道你并没有特别要求他们什么，只想让他们知道他们要为自己的行为负责。

A man may usually be known by the books he reads as well as by the company he keeps,for there is a companionship of books as well as of men; and one should always live in the best company, whether it be ofbooks or of menA good book may be among the best of ffiends. It is the same today that it always was, and it will never change. It is the most patient and cheerful of companions. It does not tum its back upon us in times of adversity or distress. It always receives us with the same kindness; amusing and instructing us in youth, and comforting and consoling us in age.Men often discover their affinity to each other by the mutual love they have for a bookjust as two persons sometimes discover a friend by admiration which both entertain for a third. There is an old proverb,“ Love me, love my dog." But there is more wisdom in this: " Love me,love my book." The book is a truer and higher bond of union. Men can think, feel, and sympathize with each other through their favorite author.They live in him together, and he in them.A good book is otten the best urn of a life enshrining the best that life could think out, for the world of a man's life is, for the most part, but the world of his thoughts. Thus the best books are treasuries of good words, the golden thoughts, which, remembered and cherished, become our constant companions and comforters.Books possess an essence ofimmortality. They are by far the most lasting products of human effort. Temples and statues decay, but books survive. Time is of no account with great thoughts, which are as fresh today as when they first passed through their author's minds, ages ago. The only effect of time have been to sift out the bad products; for nothing in literature can long survive e but what is really good.Books introduce us into the best society; they bring us into the presence of the greatest minds that have ever lived. We hear what they said and did; we see them as if they were really alive; we sympathize with them, enjoy with them, grieve with them; their experience becomes ours,and we feel as if we were in a measure actors with them in the sceneswhich they describe.The great and good do not die, even in this world. Embalmedin books, their spirits walk abroad. The book is a living voice. It is anintellect to which one stiu listens.

Some people are bom with the belief that they are masters of their own lives. Others feel they are at the mercy of fate.

Their results were recently published in the United States in the Joumal of Gerontology.People who are confident of their ability to control their lives have an intemal locus of control", and have a better chance ofbeing well adjusted their old age, said Pedersen.An "extemal locus of comrol", believing that outside forces determinethe course oflife, has been linked to depression in latter years, she said. "We are trying to understand what makes people different. Whatmakes some people age gracefully and others have a more difficult time?"she said.The study showed that while people have an irtborn predilection toward independence and self-confidence, about 70 percent of this personality trait is affected by a person's environment and lifetime experiences.Pedersen's studies, with various collaborators, probe the aging process by comparing sets of twins, both identical and fratemal, many of whom were separated at an early age.The subjects were drawn from a roster first compiled about 30 years ago registering all twins bom in Sweden since 1886. The complete list,which was extended in 1971, has 95,000 sets of twins.

Kiyosaki.Rich Dad, Poor Dad has the title of a novel rather than a how-to treatise, and indeed, much of the book is written in story form. Its central theme is summed up by the subtitle "What the Rich Teach Their Kids about Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not." The author also strongly disparages the tendency ofmost people to work for money rather than " letting money work for them".Kiyosaki illustrates his point in the first part ofthe book by narrating a story based on his childhood experiences, The title refers to the author's own highly educated father, the " poor dad" who always had to work hard to meet the family's and the "rich dad", a neighbor who had dropped out of high school but those financial acumen turned him Into a multhnillionaire. whose financial acumen turned him.The book has generated its share of negativefeedback. For one thing,some reviewers have lashed out against its anti-education slant.

This seems a less shameful state ofignorance than never having Imown it at all.The real problem with the exam system is that it teaches lessonsabout work itselfthat you need to unleam pretty smartly ifyou want to get ahead in business.First, it teaches you that there is a fairly straightforward relationship between effort and result. In exams, if you work ver3r, very hard in the evenings you are going to do an awful lot better than if you spend your evenings in the pub. In most once life, this is not true. The relationship between effort and reward is much more complicated.Second in an exam there is nowhere to hide. If you fail you may try to pin the blame on your teachers or the examiner, but in your heart you know there is no one else to blame but yourself. You either weren't bright enough, or you didn't work hard enough.One of the beauties of office work is that there is no shortage of candidates to blame for one's failures. Management, the market, the culture, one's eolleagues, the competitors, an IT failure; the options arc endless. You can screw something up royally and get away with it indefinitely.

The boy and girl glance around the crowded room. Their eyes meet. Embarrassed, they look away. Nervously, they steal glances at each other, averting their eyes when they see the other one looking back. The boy acts cool, crossing his legs and affecting a casual air - even though his heart is beat wildly. The girl, obviously smitten herself, is afraid the boy will see her looking at him. A few seconds pass. He looks at her again. She starts to blush. He nervously looks at the ceiling and whistles softly to himself. They continue their cat-and-mouse game for a seemingly interminable period of time. Will they ever talk to each other?The fact is, they have already communicated a lot, without ever saying anything. Nonverbal elements form a major part of any communication change. Some people would say it's the most
important part. According to one study, words convey only 7 percent of a person's message. intonation and voice quality communicate 38 percent, and nonverbal cues transmit a whopping 55 percent. That means people pick up more from nonverbal communication than from the words a person says, When studying about a foreign culture then, it just makes sense to pay attention to how people use nonverbal cues.Gestures prise a major form of nonverbal communication. In contast to sign language, used by deaf people to communicate elaborate messages, gestures function as visual icons which represent a single idea. But often these gestures are embarrassingly culture-bound. For example,when the Maoris of New Zealand stick out their tongue at someone ,it is a sign of respect. When American schoolchildren make the same gesture, it means just the opposite. Also, Americans often indicate OK" with their thumb and forefinger touching to form a circle. The same gesture means money" to the Japanese, "zero" to the French and a "vulgarity" to Brazilians. For that reason, people in a foreign culture must use gestures with caution.

那个男孩和女孩瞥视着那拥挤的屋子。他们的视线相遇.两个人都不好意思，于是又把视线挪开.惴惴不安地，他们互相偷看着，当发现对方也在回望自己时，他们又转移视线. 男孩表现得很酷，交叉着双腿，装着一副漫不经心的样子―虽然他的心正狂野地跳动着；女孩，很显然已坠人隋网，很怕男孩看到自己在看他。几秒钟过去了，他再一次看着她；她的脸红了起来。他紧张地看着天花板，自己轻吹着口哨。他们似乎没完没了地玩着这个猫捉老鼠的游戏。他们到底会不会交谈呢？事实上，他们已经沟通过了，即便一句话也没说。非语言要素在任何形式的双向沟通中都占了很重要的一部分。有些人会认为那是最重要的一部分。一项研究表明，言语只传达了7%的讯息，语调及音色传达了38%，而非语言的暗示传递了极大的55%o这就表明人们从非语言沟通中领悟到的比从说出来的话语中的还多。所以，在研究外国文化时，注意人们如何使用非语言暗示是很有道理的。体态是非语言沟通中很重要的一环。(2)与聋人用来沟通复杂讯息所使用的手语不同的是，体态的功能就像是视觉上的图像，它代表的是单一的意念。但往往这些体态极受文化的限制，甚至会造成尴尬的误解。例如，纽西兰的毛利人对某人伸舌头是尊敬的表现；而当美国学童作同样的动作时，它表达的意思却正好相反。还有，美国人通常用大拇指及食指环绕起一个圆圈表示“没问题“。同样的手势对日本人是“钱”的意思，对法国人是“零“的意思，对巴西人是极低俗的手势。因此，处在外国文化中的人必须小心地使用体态。

Christmas in America means different things to different people.To some people, Christmas means brightly wrapped packages under a decorated tree. To others, it means family reunions and a wonderful meal together. To Christians, it means Jesus' birthday. Christmas also means lending a helping hand to people in need: Along with all the hubbub of shopping for presents and sending Christmas cards, many people in America take time to help others.In America and around the world, Christmas offers many opportunities to spread "peace on earth, good will toward men". For example, Salvation Army bell ringers are a familiar slght to most Christmas shoppers. They stand outside malls and stores collecting money for the needy. Many churches and other organizations collect toys and clothes as Christmas gifts for poor families. Going caroling is another traditional way to bring cheer to neiShbors-especially the elderly and people who can't get out much. The Christmas spirit encourages people to help each other in many large and small ways.The spirit of helping others isn't limited to Christmas ,however,Americans help others year-round. Civic clubs such as the Lion's Club, theElk's Club and the Rotary Club take part in local community projects. Manyorganizations exist just to help others. The Make a Wish Foundation gives terminaIly ill childrena chance to have their dreams come true. Habitat for Humanity helps poor people build their own houses. And besides supporting worthy causes with their money, thousands ofAmericans donate their time by serving volunteers in hospitals, homeless shelters and schools.As the old saying goes, "Charity begins at home" - but it doesn't stop there. Americans are concerned about helping needy people in other countries, as weU. The U.S. is often one of the first countries to provide relief to areas of the world in severe need. Many American organizations reach out to suffering people in other countries. Some ofthem have programs by which
donors can sponsor needy children For a certain amount per month, people can provide these children with food, clothing and education.Americans not only give money to help people in other countries,often they give themselves, as well. Many people serve as volunteers with the Peace Corps for two years to provide assistance in some needy part of the world. They dig wells, help people improve farming techniques, build medical clinics and teach English. In addition, thousands of nussionaries from America and other countries have devoted their lives to helping people. They have built schools, hospitals, orphanages and churches in order to share God's love with those in need.As long as there are people in need, helping others will remain an important task. Americans are not the only ones who believe in helping others. People in every culture recognize that being helpful is one of the greatest virtues in life, as well as one of the sweetest joys. The Christmas season is a great time to renew our commitment to help people in need,We never know when we might need a little help ourselves.

在美国，圣诞节对不同的人代表了不同的意义。对某些人而言，圣诞节的意义在于布置好的圣诞树底下那些包装得色彩鲜艳的礼物。对另外一些人而言，它的意义则是家人团圆以及共享美好的一餐。对基督徒来说，它代表了耶稣的诞生。同时，圣诞节的意义也在于向需要帮助的人伸出援助之手。在采购礼物及寄送圣诞卡片的一阵忙乱当中，很多美国人仍会抽出时间去帮助别人。在美国及全世界各地，圣诞节提供了很多传扬“平安与世，善意与”的机会。例如，救世军的摇铃者对大多数为圣诞节购物的人们而言，是一个熟悉的景象。他们通常会站在购物中心和商店外面，为有需要的人募捐。很多教会和其他的机构会收集玩具和衣服，将其作为穷苦家庭的圣诞礼物上门唱圣诞颂歌是另钋一种能够将欢乐带给邻舍的传统方式，尤其是针对那些老人和无法常出门的人。圣诞节的精神鼓励人们在许多大大小小的事情上互相帮助。然而，助人的精神并不只有在圣诞节才能发挥。美国人年到头都在帮助他人口像狮子会(Lion's Club)、角鹿社(Elk's Club)、扶轮社(Rotary Club)这样的市民会社，都参与了地方社区的计划活动。很多机构的设立就是为了要帮助他人。许愿基金会(Make a WishFoundation)给罹患末期疾病的儿童们一个美梦成真的机会；仁爱之家(Habitat for Humanity)则帮助穷苦的人们建盖属于他们自己的房子。成千上万的美国人除了以金钱支持一些有意义的事情之外，他们也献出自己的时间在医院、流浪者之家和学校作义工服务。正如一句古老的谚语所说：“仁爱从家里开始。_但它不是就停留在那里。美国人也很关心于帮助其他国家中有需要的人们。对于世界各地极需援助的地区，美国经常是首先提出救援的国家之一。很多美国机构向其他国家中的苦难人民伸出援助之手。捐献者可以通过某些机构中的一些援助计划去赞助有需要的儿童。人们每个月只要捐出某个特定的数目，就可以提供食物、衣服和教育给这些儿童们。美国人不仅捐钱去帮助其他国家的人，他们常常也会奉献出自己。很多人志愿在“和平工作团”服务两年，去帮助世界上那些需要援助的地方。他们挖水井、帮助人们改善农业技术、盖医疗诊所以及教英文。除此之外，成千上万来自美国及其他国家的传教士，已将自己献身于帮助别人之中。他们盖学校、医院、孤儿院和教堂，将上帝的爱跟那些处在困境中的人分享。只要有人需要援助，帮助别人就仍然是一件重要的事。美国人并不是唯一相信应该帮助别人的人。每一种文化中都会有人体会到，帮助别人是生命中最伟大的美德之一，也是最甜美的喜悦之一。圣诞节是一个绝佳的时机，可以让我们重新许下承诺去帮助有需要的人。我们永远不会知道，什么时候自己可能也需要―点帮助呢？

“ I do." To Americans those two words carry great meaning. They can even change your life. Especially if you say them at your own wedding.Making wedding vows is like signing a contract. Now Americans don't really think marriage is a business deal. But marriage is serious business.It all begins with engagement. Traditionally, a young man asks the father of his sweetheart for permission to marry her. If the father agrees, the man later proposes to her. Often he tries to surprise her by “ popping the question" in a romantic way. Sometimes the couple just decides together that the time is right to get married. The man usually gives his ficancee diamond nng as a symbol of their engagement. They may be engaged for weeks, months or even years. As the big day approaches, bridal showers and bachelor's parties provide many useful gifts. Today
many couples also receive counseling during engagement. This prepares them for the challenges of married life.At last it's time for the wedding. Although most weddings follow long-held traditions, there's still room for American individualism. For example, the usual place for a wedding is in a church. But some people get married outdoors in a sceruc spot. A few even have the ceremony while sky-diving or riding on horseback! The couple may invite hundreds of people or just a few close friends. They choose their own style of colors, decorations and music during the ceremony. But some things rarely change. The bride usually wears a beautiful, long white wedding dress. She traditionally wears "something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue", The groom wears a formal suit or tuxedo. Several close friends participate in the ceremony as attendants, including the best man and the maid of honor.As the ceremony begins, the groom and his attendants stand with the minister, facing the audience. Music signals the entrance of the bride's attendants, followed by the beautiful bride. Nervously, the young couple repeats their vows. Traditionally, they promise to love each other "for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health". But sometimes the couple has composed their own vows. They give each other a gold to symbolize their marriage commitment. Finally the minister announces the big moment: "I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss your bride!"At the wedding reception, the bride groom greet their guests.Then they cut the wedding cake and feed each other a bite. Guests mingle while enjoying cake, punch and other treats. Later the bride throws her bouquet of flowers to a group of single girls. Tradition says that the one who catches the bouquet will be the next to marry. reception, playful friends "decorate" the couple's car with tissue paper, tin cans and a "Just Mamed" sign.When the reception is over ,the newlyweds run to their "decorated" car and speed off. Many couples take a honeymoon, a one- to two-week vacation trip, to celebrate their new marriage.Almost every culture has rituals to signal a change in one's life. Marriageis one of the most basic life changes for people of all cultures. So it's no Wise to find many traditions about getting married-even in America. Yet each couple follows the traditions in a way that is uniquely their own.

“我愿意”这几个字对美国人来说包含着深远的意义，它甚至可以改变一个人的生活，特别是当你在自己的婚礼上说出这句话的时候。发出结婚誓言就如同签订契约一般。虽然今天美国人并不真正认为婚姻是一种商业交易，但婚姻确实是件严肃的事。一切从订婚开始。传统上来说，年轻男子先要请求女朋友的父亲允许自己娶她。如果女方的父亲答应，然后男方才能向女方求婚。男方时常尝试以罗曼蒂克的方式“蹦出这个问题竹，想给女方一个惊喜。有时双方只是一起决定该是结婚的时候了。男方通常会送给未婚妻一只钻石戒指作为订婚的象征。订婚期可以持续几个星期、几个月，甚至几年。当大喜的日子临近时，双方各自的好友在婚前的派对上会赠送许多实用的礼物。今天，许多未婚夫妻在订婚期间还听取咨询意见，以此为应付婚姻生活的挑战作好准备。最后就该举行婚礼了。虽然大多数的婚礼沿袭长期以来的传统，但是仍有发挥美国人的个性主义的余地。例如，通常举行婚礼的地点是在教堂，但是有些人却在户外的风景点举行婚礼，少数人甚至在跳伞或骑马时举办仪式！新人可以邀请几百个客人，也可以只邀请几个最要好的朋友。婚礼的色调风格、布置和音乐都由他们自己决定。．但有些事情很少会变化，新娘通常都穿一件漂亮的长长的白色结婚礼服。按传统习惯，新娘的穿着要包括“一点旧的、一点新的、一点借来的和一点蓝色的东西”。新郎则穿着一套正式的西装或无尾晚礼服。几位亲密的朋友参与婚礼作为陪伴，包括伴郎和伴娘。婚礼开始时，新郎和他的陪伴同牧师站在一起，面对着来宾。当音乐响起时，新娘的陪伴入场，后面就跟着美丽的新娘。―对新人紧张地跟着说出他们的誓言。按传统习惯，双方许诺要彼此相爱，“不论情况是好是坏，不论家境是富是穷，不论生病还是健糜竹o但有时两人也可以编一套自己的誓言。他们互赠金戒指象征婚姻的承诺。最后，牧师宣布重大时刻的到来：“我现在宣布你们成为夫妻。你可以亲吻你的新娘！在结婚喜宴上，新娘和新郎向宾客表示欢迎。然后他们切开结婚蛋糕并互喂对方一口。来宾们一边享受蛋糕、混合饮料和其他食物，一边相互交谈。之后，新娘将她的花束投向一群单身女孩。相传抓到花束的女孩会成为下一个结婚的人。喜宴期间，爱闹的朋友用薄纸、锡罐和写着“新婚斗的标牌来“装饰丹新人的小汽车。宴会结束后，新婚的小俩口就跑向他们“被装饰好的竹小汽车，并迅速地开走。许多新人会去度蜜月，即一两个星期的度假旅行，以庆祝他们的新婚。几乎每一种文化都有仪式来标志一个人生活的变化。婚姻对于各种文化的人而言都是最基本的生活变化之一。因此发现关于结婚有许多传统习俗，就不足为奇了―在美国也不例外。然而每对新人都会以自己独持的方式来继承传统。

People have been passionate about roses since the beginning of time.In fact, it is said that the floors of Cleopatra's palace were carpeted and that the wise and knowing Confucius had a
600-book library specifically on how to care for roses.The rose is a legend on its own. The story goes that during the RomanEmpire, there was an incredibly beautiful maiden named Rhodanthe.Her beauty drew many zealous suitors who pursued her relentlessly.Exhausted by their pursuit, Rhodanthe was forced to take refuge from her suitors in the temple of her friend Diana. Unfortunately, Diana became jealous. And when the suitors broke down her temple gates to get near their beloved Rhodanthe, she became angry tuming Rhodanthe into a rose and her suitors into thornsIn Greek legend, the rose was created by Chloris, the Greek goddess of flowers. It was just a lifeless seed of a nymph that Chloris found one day in a clearing in the woods. She asked the help of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, who gave her beauty. Dionysus, the god of wine, added nectar to give her a sweet scent, and the three Graces gave her charm, brightness and joy. Then Zephyr, the West Wind, blew away the clouds so that Apollo, the sun god, could shine and made this flower bloom And so the Rose was born and was immediately crowned the Queen of Flowers.The frist true primary red rose seen in Europe was"Slater's Crimson China" introduced in 1792 from China, where it had been growing wild in the mountains. Immediately, rose breeders began using it to hybridize red roses for cultivation. Ever since, the quest for the perfect red rose has been the Holy Grail ofrosarians: a fragrant, disease-resistant, long-lasting, Iong-stemmed, rebloaming, perfectly formed rose with a clear non-fading vivid red color. Absolute perfection still hasn't been attained, and of course never will!There is a special rose language invented as a secret means of communication between lovers who were not allowed to express their love for one another openly. In the mid 18th century the wife of the British ambassador in Constantinople described this in her letters, which were published after her death. These letters inspired many books on the language of flowers, each describing the secret message hidden in each flower. A red rose bud stands for budding desire.An open white rose asks "Will you love me?" An open red rose means "I'm full o flove and desire",while an open yellow rose asks "Don't you love me any more?"

人类有史以来就钟情于玫瑰。 据说，克娄巴特拉宫殿的地面就铺满了娇嫩的玫瑰花瓣，博学的孔子有600册藏书专门讲述如何培育玫瑰。玫瑰本身就是一个传说，在罗马帝国时代，有一个名叫罗丹斯的美丽绝伦的少女。她的美丽引来了无数狂热的求婚者锲而不合地追求她。罗丹斯实在招架不住了，不得不到朋友狄安娜的神庙里躲避她的求婚者。不幸的是，狄安娜产生了嫉妒之心。当求婚者冲进了神庙的大门，要接近他们所爱恋着的罗丹斯时，狄安娜一怒之下将罗丹斯变成了一枝玫瑰花，将她的求婚者变成了花刺。在希腊传说中，玫瑰是希腊花神克罗斯创造的。当初玫瑰只是林中一个仙女的尚无生命的一粒种子。一天，花神克罗斯偶然在森林的一块空地上发现了它。克罗斯请求爱神阿佛洛狄特赋予了它美丽的容貌，让酒神狄俄尼索斯浇洒了神酒，使它拥有了芬芳的气味。又有美惠三女神将魅力、聪颖和欢乐赐予了它。随后，西风之神吹散了云朵，太阳神阿波罗用光茫将其照耀并使它开花。玫瑰就这样诞生了，并立即被封为花中之皇后。欧洲见到的第一枝真正的原色红玫瑰叫做“斯莱特中国深红”，于1792年从中国引进。当时，它．直生长在中国山区的野地里口玫瑰培育者马上开始用它进行杂交种植。从此，寻求完美的红玫瑰一直是玫瑰栽培者所追求的理想。这种玫瑰应具有芳香的气味、抵御疾病的能力，持久的花期、修长的花茎、反复开花的本领、优美的体态以及不褪色的纯鲜红颜色。然而，绝对的完美却始终未达到，当然也永远无法达到！人们发明了_一种特殊的玫瑰语言，作为不被允许公开示爱的情侣间秘密交流的方式。18世纪中期，英国驻君士坦丁堡大使的夫人在信中对此做了描述。这些信件激发了许许多多关于花草语言书籍的问世，每一本书都对每种花所隐藏的信息进行了描述。一朵红玫瑰花蕾代表萌发中的情欲，一枝盛开的白玫瑰则是在探问：“你会爱我吗?井一枝绽开的红玫瑰的含义是：“我对你满怀着爱意和渴望竹，而一枝开放的黄玫瑰则是在询问：“你是不是不再爱我了？”

There are varying opinions as to the origin ofValentine's Day. Some experts state that it originated from St. Valentine, a Roman who was martyred for refusing to give up Chrishanity. He died on February 14, 269 A.D., the same day that had been devoted to love lotteries.Legend also says that St. Valentine left a farewell note for the jailer's daughter, who had become his lover, and signed it "From Your Valentine". Other aspects of the story say that Saint Valentine served as a priest at the temple during the reign of Emperor Claudius. Claudius then had Valentine jailed for defying him. In 496 A.D. Pope Gelasius set aside February 14 to honour St. Valentine.Gradually, February 14 became the date for exchanging love messages and St. Valentine became the patron saint of lovers. The date was marked by sending poems and simple gifts such as flowers.There was often a social gathering or a ball.In the United States, Miss Esther Howland is given credit for sending the first valentline cards. Commercial valentines were introduced in the1800's and now the date is very commercialised. The town of Loveland,Colorado, does a large post office business around February 14. The spirit of 800d continues as valentines are sent out with sentimenkl versesand children exchange valentine cards at school.

关于情人节的起源有许多种说法。有关人士认为情人节是一个名叫圣瓦伦丁的人士发起的。他是罗马人，因拒绝放弃基督教而惨遭杀害。他去世的时间是公元前269年2月14日，这一天也正好是全城专心于爱情抽签的日子。而另外一种说法更具有传奇色彩，相传圣瓦伦丁曾留下一本日记给了狱卒的女儿，署名为“你的情人”，据说这名狱卒的女儿就是圣瓦伦丁的情人。还有其他的说法也颇为有趣。比如说有人认为在克劳狄君王统治时期，圣瓦仑丁曾经是一名神父，因为公然挑战克劳狄君王的权威而身陷囹圄。所以，公元前496年罗马教皇基拉西乌斯特意将2月14日作为一个特别的日子以纪念圣瓦伦丁。此后2月14日就成为了_一个具有特殊意义的日子。这天人们向自己心仪的人传递信息以示爱意。圣瓦仑丁也理所当然地成为了为恋爱中的男女们牵线搭桥的人。人们这一天会特意做诗或者将一些小礼物，如鲜花送给自己心爱的人。而且人们还会组织各种各样的聚会来庆祝这个特殊的节日.埃斯特・豪兰小姐是美国第一位因为发送情人节卡片而受到荣誉奖励的人。早在19世纪初，情人节就已初露商业化的端倪，而如今情人节已经完全被商业化了，比如每当每年2月14日来临的时候，在科罗拉多的拉夫兰这样的城镇里，人们都要派送大量的为情人节特别准备的卡片.而在这天人们往往吟歌做诗并且把这些写入卡片中送给自己喜欢的人以表达自己的爱意，学校里孩子门也喜欢互赠贺卡

Christmas celebrates the birth of Christ, the Nativity of the babe in the manger whom Christians believe was the Son of God. Indeed, the very word Christmas means "Christ festival".Yet there can be little doubt that for many it is Santa Claus - not Jesus - who is the human face of Christmas. In fact, it is fair to say that in much of the world, Santa is better known than the Christ who gave his name to the holiday.But how did the fat man in the Coca-Cola red-and-white suit become the symbol of Christmas? The truth is that like the Christmas story itself, the story of Saint Nicholas is a composite of history, myth, and legend.According to tradition, he was born in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) in about A.D. 270. When young, he traveled to Palestine and Egypt. Not long afterward, he became a bishop.During the Roman emperor Diocletian's bloody persecution of Christians in 303, Nicholas was imprisoned. Howeve r, when Constantine the Great became emperor in 306, he legalized Christianity and made it the officalreligion of the Roman Empire. Nicholas was freedThe scribes tell us that Nicholas's prayers and leadership during the great tribulation led many to become Christians, Nicholas continued to serve as bishop for many years. On December 6, 343, Nicholas the man died, and Saint Nicholas the legend was born.During his lifetime, Nicholas's reputation for generosity and kindness gave rise to stories of miracles he performed for the poor, the weak and children. After his death, devotion to Nicholas extended to all parts of Europe. His feast day was celebrated on December 6, but his reputation as a gift-giver later became attached to the celebration of Christmas on December 25.After the Reformation in the 16th century, Nicholas's cult disappeared in most Protestant countries of Europe. But his legend was united with old Nordic folktales of a magician who punished naughty children and rewarded good children with presents. In England, he became known as Father Christmas. But in Holland, Saint Nicholas' name and reputation persisted as "sinterklaas".In the 17th century , Dutch colorusts took this tradition with them to America. Later, Sinterklaas was adopted by the English-speaking majority as¨Santa Claus". The resulting image of a "jolly old elf' driving a sleigh with "eight tiny reindeef' crystallized in the 19th century . That was when Clement Moore wrote the now-famous poem "A Visit From Saint Nick. And the red-and-white suit? That was created by a Coca-Cola adman in the 1930s.Although greatly commercialized, the modern Santa Claus still embodies Saint Nicholas' generosity and love for children. And for some, he still points to the Nativity of the babe in the manger, and reminds us of the reason we celebrate Christmas.

圣诞节是庆祝基督――这名被基督徒视为上帝之子的婴儿在马槽里的诞生。的确，“圣诞节”这个词的意思就是“基督的庆典竹。然而，可能有许多人会有点疑惑，为什么圣诞节的代表人物是圣诞老人，而不是耶稣呢？事实上，这样说也不为过：在世界上许多地方，圣诞老人要比以其名字来命名该节日的基督还要出名。但是，那个穿着一套可口可乐红白颜色衣服的胖子是怎么成为圣诞节的象征的呢？事实上，跟圣诞节本身的故事一样，圣人尼古拉的故事，也是集历史、神话和传说于一身。按照传统的说法，公元270年，尼古拉出生于小亚细亚（现在的土耳其）。年轻时，他曾经到巴勒斯坦和埃及旅行。不久以后他成为了一名主教。公元3 03年，在罗马皇帝戴克里血腥迫害基督徒期间，尼古拉被捕入狱。然而，公元306年君士坦丁大帝登基称帝，他使基督教合法化，并
使之成为罗马帝国的国教，尼古拉也获释放。据史书记载，尼古拉在受难期间的祈祷和领导让很多人皈依成为基督教徒，（出狱后）尼古拉继续担任主教多年。公元343年12月6日，真人尼古拉去世，然而圣人尼古拉的传说诞生了。尼古拉在世时慷慨仁慈的名声衍生出他为穷人、弱者和孩子创造奇迹的许多故事。尼古拉死后，人们对他的挚爱延伸到欧洲各地。节日仪式定在12月6日举行，但是他作为“赠礼者”的声望，后来却与12月25日圣诞节的庆典扯上了关系。16世纪宗教改革运动以后，对尼古拉的膜拜便在多数欧洲新教国家销声匿迹了o但是有关他的传说却跟一个北欧民间故事结合了起来，故事中有位魔术师，他爱惩罚顽皮的孩子，并送礼物奖励好孩子。在英格兰，尼古拉成为家喻户晓的圣诞节之父。而在荷兰，圣人尼古拉的名声依旧以“Sinterklaas”的名字流传。17世纪，荷兰的殖民者将这个传统带到美洲。后来．“Sinterklaas”为多数说英语的人民所采用，并改成了“Santa Claus”，他最后的形象――“快乐的老矮”驾着“八只小驯鹿”拉的雪橇―是在19世纪开始变得明确具体起来的。摩尔(Clement Moore)就在那时写了《圣人尼克的来访》这首闻名至今的诗。还有那件红白套装呢？那是在20世纪30年代，可口可乐公司的广告商创造出来的。尽管现代的圣诞老人已经被高度商业化，但他仍旧表现了圣人尼古拉的宽大胸怀和对孩子们的爱。对某些人来说，他仍然象征着马槽里圣婴的诞生，并让我们想起庆祝圣诞节的缘由。

Going to pubs is a very popular leisure-time activity . In a recent survey seven out often adults said they went to pubs, one third of them once a week or more often.Everywhere there are plenty of pubs, in which people play darts, talk and drink, usually while standing up. Every pub has its name, its sign and its "regulars", its customers who turn up night after night. A few old pubs have real character but many are dull and ugly. It seems that the English think it rather indecent for people to drink alcoholic drinks in any place where they can be seen from outside. So pubs usually not only have no tables outside, but are so built that it is impossible for people outside to see in,or for those who are inside to see out. There are exceptions to this, but not many.Types of pubs vary considerably from quiet, rural establishments with traditional games, such as skittles and dominoes, to city pubs where different sorts of entertainment such live music can often be found. The opening hours of pubs, which were previously strictly controlled, have been relaxed and many pubs now serve food as well as drink.The traditional pub was a place for the men only. But things havechanged, and more and more pubs are now places where men and women sit at tables, and they often provide good lunches. Most of them have a public bar, where drinks are slightly cheaper, and a saloon bar, which middle-class people usually prefer because it is more comfortable and less crowded. Some
pubs have become more welcoming to families with younger children than in the past, although children under fourteen are still not allowed in the bar.British drinking habits have changed with larger and continental beers now more popular than traditional fonns of British beer. In cities,wine bars have appeared in competition with pubs. Although, in general,people in Britain now drink more than they used to, new typesof drinks such as alcohol-free beer and wine have appeared and there has been a general move to educate people more about the dangers of drinking too much.

去酒吧是一项非常流行的休闲活动。最近的一项调查显示7/10的成年人表示他们会去酒吧，1/3的人每周去一次或者更多。酒吧在英国随处可见。人们在那里站着玩飞镖、聊天或者喝酒。每个酒店都有自己的名字、自己的招牌和“常客竹（即那些每个晚上都会光顾的客人）。一些老店很有特色，但多数却是既无聊又丑陋。英国人似乎认为，在任何一个从外面看得见的地方喝酒都是件不体面的事。所以，这里的酒吧不仅外面不设桌子，而且它的建筑结构使你既不能从外面看到里面，也不能从里面看到外面。当然，这也有一些例外，但不多。有些酒吧比较安静，它们座落在乡下，客人在里面可以玩传统的游戏，例如九柱游戏和骨牌。城市的酒吧提供不同的娱乐，通常可以看现场音乐表演。酒吧的营业时间以前是严格控制的，现在则放宽多了’许多酒吧除了提供酒水外还供应食物。传统上的酒吧是男人的世界，但今天情况已发生了变化，在越来越多的酒吧里，你可以看见男人和女人同桌共饮，这些酒吧常常能提供很好的午餐。而且，大多数酒吧都设有一个公共酒吧区，那里的酒水相对而言比较便宜，此外，它们还设有一个沙龙酒吧区，那是中产阶级人士常常光顾的地方，那里不仅比较舒服，人也比较少，某些酒吧比过去更受到有小孩的家庭的欢迎，尽管14岁以下的小孩还是不能进酒吧的。英国人的喝酒习惯已经改变了很多，更大瓶的啤酒和大陆式啤酒现在比传统英国啤酒更受欢迎。在城市中，葡萄酒酒吧与酒馆互相竞争。虽然从总体上来说，英国人现在喝酒比以前多，但是已经出现新的没有酒精的酒类，并且人们越来越明白酒精以及酗酒的害处了.

In smoky clubs, bars and cafes across America and Europe people are all doing the same thing: enjoying the inventivesounds and style of jazz.Jazz is an advanced art form with a rich lustory . It has been called America's classical music. Why? Well, for one, it's been around for a long time-over 100 years. Also, its reputation for complicated improvisationmeans it's often approved of by academics in a way that pop is not,New Orleans is the birthplace of jazz. It started among the big brass bands of the city's black ghettos at the end of the 19th century. The new music took inspiration from two very different musical traditions. It combined the rhythm of West African dance music with the harmony and melody of European classical.Common jazz instruments are trombones, tubas, saxophones and, of course, tmmpel Indeed, one ofjazz's most infuential musicians was a trumpet player LouisArmstrong. He was the first importan tjazz soloist to emerge and is stillloved by fans, who fondly refer to him by his nickname "Satchmo".Jazz's brass instruments are often played alongside drums and stringed instruments. However, the two key elements of jazz are swing and improvisation.Swing refers to the part of jazz that makes people want to dance. It is more a feeling than a specific sound. Jazz developed as music to dance to. The evolution of US "swing" bands like those led by Duke Ellington really amved during the 1930s.The other key aspect of jazz is improvisation. This means that you don't have to play what is written. Jazz performers will start out playing an agreed song but aren't expected strictly to follow the anticipated notes.Instead, they use their talent, creativity , and feeling to add new notes and sounds to the music as they are playing. That's what jazz is all about: getting inspired, being inventive, and living for the moment.

在美国和欧洲那些烟雾弥漫的俱乐部、酒吧和咖啡馆中，人们都在做着同一件事情：享受着爵士乐的独特乐音和曲调。爵士乐是一种高尚的、历史悠久的艺术形式。它曾被称做美国的古典音乐。为什么呢？原因之一是它的历史源远流长――有100多年之久。同时，它以复杂莫测的即兴创作著称，这意味着在某种方式上它总是能够得到学者们的认可，而流行音乐则不行。新奥尔良是爵士乐的发源地。爵士乐于19世纪晚期兴起于城市黑人区的大铜管乐队。这种新音乐的灵感来源于两种极其不同的音乐传统。它将非洲西部舞蹈音乐中的节奏和欧洲古典音乐中的和声和旋律结合在了一起。常见的爵士乐器有长号、大号、萨克斯管，当然还有小号。其实，最知名的爵士乐手之一就是一名小号手：路易斯・阿姆斯特朗。他是迄今涌现出的第一位重量级的爵士乐独奏家，现在仍然受到乐迷的推崇，他们亲切地称他为“书包嘴”爵士乐中的铜管乐器通常会和鼓以及弦乐器一起演奏。但是，爵士乐的两大基本要素是摇摆乐和即兴创作。摇摆乐是爵士乐的一部分，让人听了后想跳舞，它的旋律固然奇特，但其实它带给人们更多的是一种感觉。后来爵士乐逐渐发展成为跳舞的配乐。在20世纪30年代，艾灵顿公爵等人率领的美国“摇摆乐竹乐队发生了真正的变革。爵士乐的另外一个重要因素就是即兴创作。(这就意味着你不必按照事先写好的乐谱进行演奏。爵士乐演奏者会从一首熟悉的曲子开始演奏，但他们并不严格遵守预先的曲调。相反，他们在演奏中发挥他们的天分、创造力以及灵感，为音乐注入新的音韵和旋律。这就是爵乐：灵感迸发、充满创造力、为现时而奏。

It seems that hip-hop music is ubiqrutous these days, from popularradio to TV commercials. Whatever your opinion of hip-hop music may be, there is no denying it has impacted pop culture around the world, andshows no signs of slowing down.Hip-hop brings with it its own unique terminology. " Rap" is the literalaction of speaking over a beat.“Hip-hop" is both a kind of music and a culture, which includes four main elements: "emceeing" (rapping over a beat), "deejaying" (spinning records and mixing samples), "breaking" (an acrobatic form of dance), and "graffih art". Along with these are other distinctive. aspects ofhip-hop culture such as language and fashion.Hip-hop has its roots in the African traditions of percussion and oral storytelling. Its modernorigins, however, can be found in New York City's crime-ridden South Bronx in the early 1970s. Fed up with the insipid disco of the times, youth who were short on money but rich in ingenuity created a new, dynamic art form: verbally competing and chronfcling life in the ghetto by rapping poetry over a beat.The person regarded as the father of hip-hop is Kool Herc, a Jamaican who immigrated to New York at age 12. Around 1973, he began deejaying at house parties in the Bronx. To his infectious playlist of R&B, soul, and funk he added the Jamaican customs of "toasting" (talking to the crowd) and "dub talk" (speaking thythmically over a beat).Hip-hop culture's positive energy was fostered by Afrika Bambaataa, a former gang leader and dj who is regarded as the godfather of hip-hop. His efforts brought together the burgeoning hip-hop community and inspired gangs to battle creatively through rapping and breaking rather than tbrough violence.In the 1980s, as hip-hop became more popular, new off shoots developed. East Coast styles were generally hard-core, with rappers espousing political and social ideals, often from an afro-centric perspective. West Coast hip-hop was heavy on gangster rap, filled with references to gangs, guns, and the inescapability of street life. The West Coast style caught the larger public's imagination, and became wildly popular in urban and suburban areas alike.While some fans complain that today's hip-hop has lost its edge and political message, the genre continues to expand, innovate, and influence. Through its brief history, hip-hop has gone from just two tumtables to samplers and live musicians; from rapping on a four count to increasingly complex verbal gymnastics; and from its roots in the South Bronx to the four comers ofthe world."Run" of the East Coast hip-hop band Run DMC once said that when people called hip-hop a fad, they had no idea of the passion that lay behind it. Once considered a flash in the pan, hip-hop is set to continue its path of creation and celebration,bringing more and more converts along for the ride.

现在，从大众广播到电视广告，嘻哈音乐似乎无所不在。不管你对嘻哈音乐的看法怎么样，无可否认它已经对世界各地的通俗文化造成了冲击，并且没有减弱的迹象。嘻哈风带来了一些专有术语：“说唱乐”是指配合节奏念文字的动作。“嘻哈”既是一种音乐，同时也是一种文化，嘻哈文化包含4大要素“MC"（随节奏说唱）、“DJ”（转动唱片及混音）、“霹雳舞”（一种特技般的舞蹈），和“涂鸦艺术_o除此之外嘻哈文化还有其他一些特殊
的方面，如语言和服装时尚等。嘻哈文化起源于非洲传统的打击乐和口述故事。然而，现代嘻哈则是20世纪70年代初期来源于纽约市犯罪行为猖獗的南布朗克斯区。那些口袋空空却富于创新的年轻人，厌倦了当时流行的乏味的迪斯科音乐，便创造出了-一种新的动感十足的艺术形式：通过配合节奏念词的方式，在言辞上相互较量，并且记录了贫民区的生活。被公认为嘻哈之父的库尔・贺克是牙买加人，他是12岁移民到纽约的。1973年左右他开始在布朗克斯区的家庭宴会中担任DJ。在他主持的节奏布鲁斯、灵歌和方克舞等极富感染力的节目里，他还加入了“toasting”（对群众说话）和“dub talk”（跟着拍子有节奏地讲话）等牙买加风俗节目。培养嘻哈文化的正面力量要归功于曾做过帮派头目和DJ的阿弗里卡・班巴塔，他被公认为嘻哈文化的教父。他不仅努力把迅速发展的嘻哈音乐团体团结起来，而且还激励帮派份子在说唱和霹雳舞上进行创造性的互相较量，而不是通过暴力。80年代，随着嘻哈风更加盛行，新的流派发展起来。总的来说东岸风格是核心力量，说唱歌手通常以非洲为中心的角度，拥护政治和社会理想政治和社会理想。西岸的嘻哈风主要是帮派份子的说唱，充满了关于帮派、枪枝和不可避免的街头生活等内容。西岸风格引起了更多群众的兴趣，所以在都市和近郊地区都很受欢迎。尽管有些嘻哈迷抱怨说，现在的嘻哈文化中，原有的锐气和政治信息已经没有了'但这种类型仍在不断扩展、革新并且发挥其影响力。在其短暂的历史中，嘻哈文化从仅有两个唱机转盘发展到了混音器和现场演奏的乐手；从4拍子的说唱到越来越复杂的嘴上功夫，从南布朗克斯的发祥地到世界的每个角落。东岸嘻哈乐团“Run DMC竹中的“Run”曾说：在有些人称嘻哈只是一种时尚时，他们根本不了解它背后的热情。一度被视为昙花一现的嘻哈风，却决心继续走他的创造与赞美之路，并带领更多的归附者上路。

Few words in the English language have such a special meaning.Home is a place where you can relax, kick back and just be yourself. Just about everyone bas a strong opinion of what makes a house a home. And for most people in America, home should be, above all, comfortable.Americans like their homes to refiect their personal tastes. Many do-it-yourselfers enjoy fixing up their house and making it more "livable".They often try to create a cozy atmosphere so that when they'reat home, they'll really feel“at home". Sofas and lounge chairs may be heavily padded and arranged in groupings conducive to relaxed conversation. The bathroom even receives special attention. Carpeted floors, scented soaps, colorful wall paper and decorative curtains adorn the "comfort room" in many homes. And on average, Americans have more bathrooms than any other people in the world.Lisa Marie Odegard, an interior designer in Bozeman, Montana, comments that "a home is a haven. People want an open, easy feeling to make their homes comfortable". For that reason, many new homes now have big, open kitchens and vaulted ceilings.Americans try to make the most of their space, too. The majority of homes have built-in closets and shelves, and people spare no pains to add dressers, filing cabinets and closet organizers to maximize their storage space. Although keeping the house neat is ofien a constant battle,Americans feelit's a attle worth fighting.People in America keep an eye on the latest trends in interior design.In the 80s, the "country" look dominated the home decorating scene, Rustic funuture and shelves full of old-fashioned knick-knacks created a homey atmosphere remiruscent of ruralAmerica several generations back. The 90s have brought in another longing for the past: the retr0 50s and 60s look- plain and simple furniture with square backs and arms and block-style legs.Some parts of the country have their own regional preferences. In the western Uruted States, home owners favor the Navajo Indian style of the Southwest or the cowboy look. In contrast, Easterners prefer French Country or more "fussy" styles.With all this attention to their homes, you would think Americans place a high premium on housekeeping. In fact, however, keeping house doesn't receive as much attention as it used to. Why? The fast-paced lifestyles of the 90s allow little spare time for dusting, vacuuming and scrubbing the tub. Ironically，however, even though more and more women work outside the home, women still do twice as much house work as men. Modem conveniences like the washing machine, the vacuum cleaner, and the dishwasher have taken some of the drudgery out of
household chores. But in general, Americans these days take their cue from books like How to Avoid Housework.As a result, you might think American homes of the 90s are less than spotless. Witness the fact that sales of household cleaning products have declined in recent years. Besides that, Americans seem to be less persnickety about their housecleaning-especially in areas that nobody sees. Vacuum under the sofa? Dust the baseboards? Are you kidding? Ironically, though, American women seem quite satisfied with their housekeeping, according to a national survey conducted in 1995-96. Besides that, people are designing their homes with low-maintenance features-tile in bathrooms and kitchens as well as marble on countertops-to cut down on the need for frequent cleaning. Even so,more and more people are hiring outside help to clean their houses. ARoper poU found that one in six Americans hired cleaning help last year,up from one in 10 in 1986. One professional housecleaning service, MerryMaids, has grown to over 800 francluses in recent years.In a pre-Revolutionary War speech in 1761, James Otis made thefamous remark that "a man's home is his castle". Americans like their castle to be as comfortable as possible. They would like to have a home they can be proud of, a place they can call their own. Not every one's home looks like a castle, but "be it ever so humble, there's no place like home".

在英文中没有几个字像家这个字一样有着特别的意义。家是一个你可以放松、做回你自己的地方。大概每个人对于如何把一间屋子变成一个家都非常有主见。对于大多数的美国人来说，家最重要的应该是舒适。美国人喜欢让家反映出他们个人的品味。许多喜欢自己动手人沉醉于修补他们的房子并让它更“适于居住竹” 他们常试着营造一个温暖而舒适的气氛，这样当他们待在家时，会真的感觉到“毫无拘束”。沙发及安乐椅可能会被铺上厚厚的垫子，并运用不同空间组合的摆设，让坐的人可以轻松地谈话。甚至连浴室他们也颇费心思：铺有地毯的地板、香气四溢的肥皂、彩色的壁纸及装饰窗帘，如此就打扮出了许多家庭的“舒服之地”。平均来说，美国人拥有的浴室比世界上其他的人都多。蒙大拿州柏斯曼的一位室内设计师丽莎・区迪嘉谈到：“家是一个避难所。人们想要一个开放、轻松的感觉来让他们的家变得很舒适。”因为这个原因，现在许多新房子都有大而开放的厨房以及拱形的屋顶。美国人也试着将空间做最佳的利用。 大多数的家庭都有壁橱以及架子，人们也不辞辛劳地添加橱柜、文件柜以及壁柜分隔架来加大储藏空间。虽然让房子维持整洁像是一场永无止尽的长期战役，但美国人觉得它是一场值得打下去的战役。美国人也会注意室内设计的最新时尚。80年代，“乡村竹风貌主导了家庭装潢；摆满旧式风格的小摆设的质朴家俱及架子，创造出一种会令人想起几代人以前以农业为主的美国之家庭气氛。90年代又带入另一个怀J日情愫：回溯到50及60年代风貌――有四方形靠背、把手以及有方正桌脚的朴素、简单的家俱。国内某些地方的人们有他们自己地区性的偏好，在美国西部，屋主们喜欢西南部印地安拿佛和族或是牛仔式的风格。相对的，东部人喜欢法国乡村或是更漂亮的形式。在他们家花了这么多的心思，你大概会认为美国人非常重视家庭的打理与清洁，但是事实上，整理家务已不像以前一样受重视。为什么呢？90年代步调快速的生活方式几乎没有留什么时间掸灰尘、吸尘以及刷洗浴缸。 然而，讽刺的是，即使越来越多的妇女在外工作，她们还是比男人多做两倍的家务。虽然像是洗衣机、吸尘器和洗碗机等现代家电已经替代了处理家务事中一些乏味、辛苦的工作。但一般而言，美国人今天已会向 《如何避免家务》这类的书来求救。因此，你可能会认为90年代的美国家庭大概不是一尘不染。由家用清洁产品的销售量在近几年呈下降的趋势便可见一斑。此外，美国人似乎对于家庭的清洁不那么吹毛求疵了――特别是对那些没有人会看到的地方。吸沙发下的灰尘？掸脚板？你在开玩笑吗？（他们是不会做的）但可笑的是，根据1995～1996年做的一项全国性调查，美国妇女似乎对他们的家务整理挺满意。除此之外，人们不再选择需要时时清洁的材料来设计他们的家-―在浴室及厨房贴磁砖以及做大理石的台面――一以减少打扫的次数。即使如此，越来越多的人还会雇用外人来协助清理屋子。一项洛普民意调查发现，去年有1／6的美国人雇用清洁服务，较1986年的1/10比率上升了许多。一个专业性的家务清理服务“陕乐女佣公司"在最近几年已发展到拥有800多家的连锁店。在1761年独立战争前的一次演说中，詹姆士・欧提斯留下卜句名言一“男人的家是他的城堡”。美国人喜欢他们的城堡能够尽可能的舒适，他们都想要有一个引以为荣的家，一个可以属于他们自己的港湾。并不是每个人的家都看起来像是一座城堡，但是“即使是非常简陋，也没有一个地方可以比得上家”

The English are passionate lovers of competitive sports; and whenthey are neither playing nor watching games they like to talk about them,or when they cannot do that, to think about them.The game peculiarly associated with England is cricket. Nearly every village in England, has its own cricket club. A first-class match lasts for up to five days, with six hours play on each dayHowever, for the majority of the British public the eight months ofthe football season are more important than the four months of cricket.Professional football is always a big business. The Cup Final, which isplayed in May each year in London, is the greatest event of the season andone ofthe most famous football matches in the world.Rugby football is played with an egg-shaped ball. It can be adangerous game as players wear no protective clothing. This form of sport got its name because it originated from the famous Rugby Public School.The sport is favoured by the middle class and it is also the game played at the great majority of "public schools".Most secondary schools have playing fields, and boys usually play rugby or football in winter and cricket in summer as a normal school activity ; while schoolgirls play tennis and a sort of baseball in summer and netball and hockey in winter. Men's basketball is almost unknown.The more social adult games of golf and tennis are played by great numbers of people. Golf courses are also meeting places of the business community. It is, for example, very desirable for bank managers to play golf. Moreover, there are plenty of tennis clubs. Every town provides numerous tennis courts in public parks, and anyone can play tennis cheaply.Next to Association Football, the chief spectator sport in English life is horse racing. Their horse racing mainly takes place on working days and during working hours. The whole atmosphere of a race meeting still belongs in some ways to the eighteenth century with old divisions between upper and lower people. Every day people all over the country bet on the day's races.Although the British are so fond of watching horses racing, they are not very interested in being spectators at occasions when human beings race together. Remarkably few people are interested in bicycle racing. On the other hand, rowing, in fours or eights, occupies a leading place in thesporting life of schools and universities which have suitable water near by. It is watched from the river banks by vast crowds of spectators.When English people use the word "hunting" they usually mean foxlumting, a sport which is popular among a small but important nunority . Thereare many people who would like to see fox-hunting forbidden by law on the ground that it is crueL but there is little possibility that this will be done.The moorlands of the north and of Scotland are rich in grouse andpartridge. And to go shooting on the moors is perhaps the most distinctiveof upper-class activities. The opening of shooting season on August 12thattracts many top people to the moors. They pay enormous amounts fortheir pleasure. Being afraid of losing votes, modem leaders do not shoot, or ifthey do they try their best to avoid the photographers.

英国人是竞技运动的爱好者,他们就会谈论和思考它们。当他们不打球和不看比赛的时候.英国特有的运动是板球。在英格兰，几乎每个村子都有自己的板球俱乐部.一场一流的比赛要持续长达5天的时间，每天要打上6个小时。不过，对于多数英国人来说，前后长达8个月的足球季节要比4个月的板球更加重要。职业足球是一个大的体育项目。每年5月在伦敦举行的足总杯是足球赛季的头等大事，也是全世界最闻名的足球赛事之一。英式橄榄球使用的是一个鸡蛋形的球，由于球手不穿防护外衣，使得该项运动成为一种很危险的运动。这种运动因发源于著名的拉格比公学而得名。该项运动深受中产阶层的喜爱，在很多著名的公学中都很流行。多数中学中都设有动场地，男生们通常在冬季打橄榄球或足球，在夏季一般打板球。女生们在夏天打网球和一种垒球，在冬天则是打无挡板篮球和曲棍球。至于男式篮球，基本上可以说是无人问津的。比较社会化的成人运动是高尔夫球和网球，打这两种球的人很多。高尔夫球场还是很重要的商业交往中心，像银行经理这样的人就很喜欢打高尔夫。此外，网球俱乐部也随处可见，每个镇上的公园里都有网球场，人们不用花太多钱就能打场网球。除了英式足球以外，英国生活中一项重要的观看运动便是赛马。‘大多数的赛马比赛都在工作日和工作时间举行。而且，在很大程度上，赛马场上的气氛仍像18世纪那样，上流社会和普通平民是分开的。每天，全国各地都有人在当天的赛马比赛上赌上一把。虽然英国人那么热衷于观看赛马，但他们对人类的赛跑却不感兴趣。喜欢自行车赛的人更是罕见。但另一方面，4人或8人的划船比赛却在邻近水域的学校和大学里占有很重要的地位，比赛时，河两岸会有大群的观众观看助阵。英国人提到“打猎”时，他们通常指的是猎狐。喜爱这种运动的人很少，但他们都是英国社会中举足轻重的人。今天虽然有很多人认为猎狐残酷而违背人性并主张立法禁捕，不过，这一主张实现的可能性却很小。英国北部和苏格兰的沼泽地区有很多山鸡和山鹑，在沼泽地里打鸟也许是最典型的上流运动。每年月12日打猎季节开始后，便有很多上流人士云集此地，不惜千金来追求此项享受。现代领导人由于害怕失去选票一般不再打猎，如果打，他们也尽量避开照相机的镜头。

To the uninitiated, rugby is a game in which a bunch of powerfully built men throw themselves at one another in pursuit of an oval ball. Infact, this ancestor of modernAmerican and Canadian football can seemmore like an organized brawl than a highly technical sport with a complex set of rules. Apart from its sometimes chaotic demeanor, rugby is alsounusual among modern sports in that its origins can be traced back to asingle, seminal event.In 1823, during a soccer game at the prestigious Rugby School in central England, one of the players impulsively picked up the ball andran with it. The way soccer was played in those days, William Webb Ellis'rash action was practically suicidal. But his novel approach was taken upby other students, who went on to develop a new style of football. Known as Rugby football, it mainly involved throwing and running with the ball rather than kicking it.The game grew in popularity, and in 1871, the Rugby Union was formed in London. It drew up the modern rules for a 15-a-side game using an oval ball. Nowadays, rugby is played in more than 80 countries around the world. As for William Webb Ellis, his spirit lives on. His name has been given to the trophy awarded to the winners of the quadrennial Rugby World Cup tournament.For young men in New Zealand, the pinnacle of sporting achievement is widely reckoned to be donning the famous black uniform of the nationalrugby team. Ever since 1905, when the first officially sanctioned New Zealand touring team swept aside all opposition on a tour of Britain, the fearsome All Blacks have retained an aura ofinvincibility that has rarely been overcome.Such is the reputation of the All Blacks that some believe they gain a psychological advantage over their opponents the moment they step out onto the playing field. If such an advantage really exists, it can only be enhanced when, as tradihon dictates, the team performs the celebrated haka before the match kicks off.Haka is the generic term for a traditional dance of the Maori people. Its connection with the game of rugby goes back to the late 19th century,when the New Zealand Native Team performed one on an unofficial tour of Bri.tain. Nowadays, the haka is still led by a player of Maori descent whenever and wherever the All Blacks take the field.While recent years have seen the All Blacks struggling to match their past successes, the emergence of skillful p_rofessionals such asTongan-bom winger Jonah Lomu ensures that the famous black jersey with the silver fem on the left breast is still able to instill awe in opponents and spectators alike.

在外行的眼中，橄榄球赛只不过是一大群身材健壮的男人相互冲撞推挤，为了一颗椭圆形的球你争我夺的比赛。事实上，这个现代美国和加拿大地区足球的始祖，看起来更像是一场有组织的争吵，而不像是遵循复杂规则、讲究高度技巧的运动。 与其他现代运动相比较，橄榄球的不寻常之处，除了屡见不鲜的混乱场面之外，还在于它的起源，它可以追溯到某―重要的事件。1823年，一场英格兰中部享有盛名的拉格公学(Rugby School)举行的足球赛中，一名球员一时冲动，把球拿起来带着跑。以当时的足球玩法，威廉・韦伯・艾利斯的鲁莽行动无疑是“自寻死路”。但他的这种新打法竟被其他学生接过来，继而发展成一种新式的足球――被称为橄榄球(Rugby football)，它以传球和带球跑为主，而不去踢球。这项运动日见普及，到1871年，“橄榄球联盟”在伦敦成立，并拟定了现代的规则：每队15人，使用椭圆形球比赛。现今，世界上有80多个国
家举行橄榄球赛。至于艾利斯本人，他的精神将永存。4年一次的世界杯橄榄球锦标赛的奖杯就是以“威廉・韦伯・艾利斯杯”命名的。对新西兰的年轻人来说，运动生涯的最高成就，就是能穿上那套出名的橄榄球国家代表队的黑色制服。 自1905年第一支正式批准的新西兰代表队远征英国参加巡回比赛并横扫所有对手、大获全胜以来，这支令人生畏的“全黑”就保持了几乎不可战胜的气势。这就是“全黑队”的名声，有些人认为，他们走上球场的那一刻，就在心理上压倒了对手。如果这样的优势真的存在，当这支队伍在传统的指引下，在比赛前跳起著名“哈卡”舞时，这种优势才能得到加强。“哈卡”是毛利人．种传统舞蹈的通称。它与橄榄球运动的联系可以追溯到19世纪末，新西兰土著球队在英国各地进行非正式比赛期间表演了这种舞蹈。现在，不论何时何地，只要“全黑”参加比赛，就会有一名毛利人后裔球员带头跳“哈卡”舞。近几年，“全黑队”想努力恢复旧日荣光，球技超群的职业球员如汤加出生的侧翼大将乔纳-洛姆等的一一出现，可以保证这件著名的左胸前镶有银蕨 的黑色球衣还是能让敌手胆战心惊、让观众肃然起敬的。

On 19 September 1893 New Zealand became the first country in the world to give women the right to vote.Women in other countries did not enjoy this equality and campaigned for justice for many years.In 1910 a second International Conference of Working Women was held in Copenhagen. A woman named Clara Zetkin (Leader of the'Women's Office' for the Social Democratic Pafly in Germany) tabled the idea of an hiternational Women's Day, She proposed that every year in every country there should be a celebration on the same day-a Women's Day-to press for their demands. The conference of over 100 women from 17 countries, representing unions, socialist parties working women's clubs, and including the first three women elected to the Finnish
parliament, greeted Zetkin's suggestion with unanimous approval and thus Intemational Women's Day was the result.The very first International Women's Day was launched the following year on 19 March (not 8 March). The date was chosen because on 19 March in the year of the 1848 revolution, the Prussian king recognized for the first time the strength of the armed people and gave way before the tbreat of a proletarian uprising. Among the many promises he made, which he later failed to keep, was the introduction of votes for women， Plans for the first International Women's Day demonstration were spread by word of mouth and in the press. During the week before International Women's Day two journals appeared: The Vote for Women in Germany and Women's Day in Austria. Various articles were devoted to Intemational Women's Day: 'Women and Parliament', “The WorkingWomen and Municipal Affairs', 'What Has the Housewife got to do with Politics?', etc. The articles thoroughly analyzed the question of the equality of women in the government and in society .All articles emphasized the same point that it was absolutely necessary to make parliament more democratic by extending the franchise to women.Success of the first International Women's Day in 1911 exceeded all expectation. Meetings were organized everywhere in small towns and even the villages halls were packed so full that male workers were asked to give up their places for women. Men stayed at home with their children for a change, and their wives, the captive housewives, went to meetings.During the largest street demonstration of 30,000 women, the policed.ecided to remove the demonstrators' banners so the women workers made a stand. In the scuffle that followed, bloodshed was averted only with the help of the socialist deputies in Parliament.In 1913 International Women's Day was transferred to 8 March and this day has rema:ined the global date for International Wommen's Day ever since. During Intemational Women's Year in 1975, IWD was given official recognition by the United Nations and was taken up by many governments. Intemational Women's Day is marked by a national holiday in China, Armenia, Russia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Moldova, Ukraine and Vietnam.

1869年，约翰・密尔是第一个在国会上提出妇女应该有选举的权利的议员0 1893年9月19日，新西兰成为世界上第一个妇女拥有表决权的国家。很长一段时间里，其他很多国家的妇女们并不能够享受到这种公平和参加选举的权利。1910年，第2次关于劳动妇女的国际会议在哥本哈根举行。一位名叫克拉拉・蔡特金（德国的社会民族党妇女办公室主席）的妇女提交丁关于国际妇女节的议案。她提议，每个国家每年都应该在某一天来庆祝妇女的节日，以便表达她们的要求，参加会议的100多名妇女分别来自17个国家，她们有来自工会的、社会政党的、妇女俱乐部的，其中包括3名被选进芬兰议会的女性，并以一致通过的方式产生了国际妇女节。紧接着第2年的第一个妇女节是3月19日，不是明8日。之所以选3月19日，是因为1848年的革命，那一年，普鲁士国王被认为是第一次承认武装人员的力量并在无产阶级起义的威胁下让位. 在他众多的承诺中，其中就有让妇女拥有选举权的启蒙，但是后来他并没有履行诺言。第1届国际妇女节的示范计划是通过口耳相传和印刷在各种报刊上传开的。在国际妇女节的前一个星期出现了两篇新闻：德国妇女的表决权和奥地利的妇女节。同时出现了各种用来专门描写国际妇女节的文章，如“妇女和国会”，“劳动妇女和市政”，“关于政治，家庭主妇可以做些什么？”等等。这些文章深入地分析了在政府和社会方面妇女的平等问题。 所有的文章都强调了同样的问题，那就是议会应该通过给予妇女公民权来体现民主，这是绝对需要的。191 1年第一届妇女节的成功举行超出了所有人的预期。人们在全世界的各个角落甚至是小村庄里组织召开了会议，以至于男人们被要求放弃他们的位置，将其让给妇女们。男人们待在家里照顾其孩子，他们的妻子，曾经在家的家庭主妇去参加会议。在最宽的街道上有3万多名妇女在游行，警察决定把游行的横幅标语拿走才使得妇女们能有个站立的地方。在接下来的对峙中，在国会社会代表的帮助下才避免了流血事件。1913年的国际妇女节改为3月8日，这．天被保留了下来，并且作为至今的国际妇女节。在1975年的国际妇女节上，联合国正式给予国际妇女节官方确认，井且被许多国家的政府采纳接受。现在，国际妇女节在中国、亚美尼亚、俄罗斯、阿塞拜疆、白俄罗斯、保加利亚、哈萨克斯坦、吉
尔吉斯斯坦、马其顿、摩尔多瓦、乌克兰和越南等国家作为一个节假日。

In 1895, a man named Luigi Lavazza purchased a little grocery store in northern Italy for about $20. Today, over one hundred years later, Luigi Lavazza S.P.A is the irrefutable leader of the espresso market in Italy, boasting nearly 45 percent of the total coffee market share. The company owes its success to its dynanuc approach to business and careful attention to its customers' needs.In Lavazza's store, coffee was sold raw and then roasted according to each customer's personal preference. Luigi Lavazza was considerably skilled at carefully selecting the amount of each ingredient required for one particular blend as well as expertly determining the degree of roasting.Over the next sixty years, the company experienced rapid commercial growth with its foray into the wholesale market and its decision to narrow down its range of products. By the mid forties, the company, now Luigi Lavazza S.P.A, began specializing in the production of coffee.The firm continued expanding by leaps and bounds, and introduced the first vacuum-packed coffee with a long shelf life in the sixties. Distribution soon covered all ofltaly, and the next two decades saw the conquering of both European and world markets. With its devotion to developing clever new tecl:uuques and products, Luigi Lavazza S.p.A shows no signs of slowing down, and will likely be giving other coffee companies a run for their money for a while yet.

If you are asked to name some national emblems of China, the dragon with probably be one of the famous images that pop into your head. We often consider ourselves "the descendants of the dragon". It is not unfamiliar to you that your parents hope that you "may become the dragon",As a mythical creature, the dragon is deeply rooted in Chinese culture. Traditionally, dragons are considered to govern rainfall. They have the power to decide where and when the rain falls. Jn addition, the dragon is a symbol of imperial power. The emperors thought they were real dragons and the sons of the heaven.While Chinese believe dragons bring prosperity and good fortune, the creature is regarded differently Westem countries. In the Bible, dragons represent the devil and they trick the world. "Western people usually see dragons as cold-blooded reptiles, like snakes," said Jonathan Haagen, copy editor for the Teens. "They are cruel killers, breathing fire and capturing women." He added that people think of dragons as being dishonest because of their forked tongues.More often than not, dragons in Western literature are presented as monsters against which the hero must battle. It is a common tale for a mediaeval knight to kill a dragon and save a princess and her country from its evil. Even the popular boy wizard Harry Potter has to battle a deadly dragon and get back a golden egg from its nest in "llarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire",So, some Chinese experts have suggested changing the English translation of dragon to "Loong". They believe the misunderstanding of the dragon is due to the translation.However, dragons are not all bad in the West.“Puff the Magic Dragon" is a well-known song. The lyries tell a bitter-sweet story of the dragon Puff and his playmate Jackie Paper, a little boy. When Jackie grows up, he loses interest in the imaginary adventures of childhood and leaves Puff upset. "Puff represents the innocence of a child's imagination , which is very positive for a dragon," said Haagen.

假如有人问你，哪些东西能够代表中国，龙可能会是浮现在你脑海里的一个答案。我们中国人经常称自己为“龙的传人” 而且你也知道父母都“望子成龙”作为一个神秘的生物，龙深深地植根于中国文化之中。人们通常认为龙是主管降雨的神，他们有权力决定下雨的时间和地点。而且，龙还是皇权的象征，皇帝都认为自己是真龙天子。中国人认为龙会带来繁荣和好运，而西方人并不认同这点。在圣经里，龙是邪恶势力的代表，并经常给世界捣乱。《21世纪中学生英文报》编辑乔纳森・哈根说：“西方人通常将龙视为和蛇一样的冷血爬虫。他们是残忍的杀人魔鬼，能够喷火，还掠取妇女”竹他还补充说，龙有叉形的舌头，所以人们认为龙不诚实。在很多情况下，西方文学把龙描写成为英雄要铲除的怪物。一个司空见惯的传说是，一位中世纪的骑士杀死了龙，拯救了公主和她的国家。甚至在著名的小说《哈里波特和火焰杯》里，小巫师哈里・波特也要打败一条凶恶的龙，以从它的巢穴里抢回金蛋。所以，有些中国专家建议将龙的英文翻译“dragon”改为“Loong”他们认为，西方关于中国龙的种种误解都是由于翻译错位产生的。然而，西方世界当中的龙并不全是坏蛋。有一首非常著名的歌曲叫做《神奇龙》，它的歌词描写了一头叫做波夫的龙和其小男孩玩伴杰克。派波之间的甜蜜而又痛苦的故事。杰克长大之后就对孩童时这位虚幻的玩伴失去了兴趣，这让波夫非常伤心。哈根说，“波夫代表了儿童纯洁的想象力，这是龙的一个非常正面的形象。”

街头表演对于街头艺人来说是一项有趣的活动.街头艺人，无论是专业的音乐家还是业余爱好者，都会从匿名表演中享受到乐趣。表演是否成功的唯一标准便是街头艺人吸引和保持人群注意力的能力。身处欢乐的人群之中并即时玩弄演奏技巧是一件乐事。在你开始随意演奏吉他之前，要先搞清你想要表演的场所对街头表演有什么法律规定。即使是在可以合法进行街头表演的地方，也要确保一点，那就是你所吸引住的一堆人群到最后不能阻碍了交通的运行.街头表演是乐趣，但是，如果你违反了法律的话就并非如此了。要尊重当地居民。午夜时分，不要在居民区敲打你的架子鼓，也不要侵占其他街头艺人的空间。对听众要有判断力。试着演奏对他们有吸引力的乐曲. 如果他们是老人，就演奏一些老歌金曲，如果他们是年轻人，就给他们多演奏当代曲目。同时还要观察他们的反应。―旦人群开始出现厌烦情绪，就改变曲目。在选择场地的时候，要考虑到音响效果。许多街头艺人选择地铁通道是因为那里有趣的声音效果。不过，人们通常会快速走过这些区域而不太可能逗留。大街上的门道和门洞是个更好的选择。而火车站、汽车站和其他人们要做停留的地方则是最佳的场所。

"More and more couples are looking for an extraordinary wedding: under water, during parachute jumping, on the football ground-creativity knows no bounds," said the airline.“If our request is replied positively, then so-called 'floating on cloud nine' would get a new meaning for people in love," said Paul Simmons, Easyjet's UK regional general manager.A "small charge" would be levied for the service if approved, a spokesman added. Luton Borough Council said it was awaiting full details of the proposal before assessing whether it could approve in-flight weddings. "We have only just received a letter from Easyjet and wni be responding in due course," said a council spokesman. "While there are clearly laws goveming marriage ceremorues, we are not yet aware of the full details of what Easyjet are proposmg to do, therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further."Easyjet captain Jeffery Husson added:“To officiate a wedding is a special honor for me, It would be exciting, if I could marry couples above the clouds."

One of the most widespread superstitions is that thirteen is unlucky,and so generalis this idea that many hotels do not have a room number thirteen. Some people will not start a trip on the 13th day of the month,especially if it happens to be a Friday. Various explanations have been given as to the origin ofthis superstition. The most popular explanation that there were thirteen persons at the Last Supper, Judas being frequently represented as the thirteen. The superstition about the number thirteen is universal. We can find it in France, England, throughout almost the whole of Europe, and in America. It has long been a matter of etiquette in France to avoid having exactly thirteen guests at a dinner or party, and the person who is invited to fill the fourteenth seat at the table is usually known as quatorizieme.The English writer Addison, who wrote early in the 18th century, tells us a story about the superstition in his time." I remember I was once in a mixed assembly that was full of noise and mirth, when on a sudden an old woman unluckily observed there were thirteen of us in company. This remark struck a panic terror into several who were present, insomuch that one or two of the ladies were going to leave the room, but a friend of mine, taking notice that one of our female companions was big with child, affirmed there were foufieen in the room, and that, instead of portending one of the company should die, it plaidy forebode one of them should be bom.

An American friend has invited you to visit his family. You've never been to an American's home before, and you're not sure what to do.Should you take a gift? How should you dress? What time should you arrive? What should you do when you get there? Glad you asked. When you're the guest, you should just make yourself at home. That's what hospitality is all about: making people feel at home when they're not.The question of whether or not to bring a gift often makes guests squirm. Giving your host a gift is not just a social nicety in some cultures-it's expected. But in American culture , a guest is not obligated to bring a present, Of course, some people do bring a small token of appreciation to their host. Appropriate gifts for general occasions might be flowers, candy or-if the family has small children'toys. If you choose not to bring a gift, don't worry. No one will even notice.American hospitality begins at home-especially when it involves food. Most Americans agree that good home cooking beats restaurant food any day. When invited for a meal, you might ask, "Can I bring anything?"Unless it's. a potluck, where everyone brings a_dish, the host will probably respond, "No,just yourself." For most informal dinners, you should wear comfortable, casual clothes. Plan to arrive on time, or else call to inform your hosts of the delay. During the dinner conversation:it's customary to compliment the hostess on the wonderful meal. Of course, the biggest compliment is to eat lots of food!When you've had plenty, you might offer to clear the table or wash the dishes. But since you're the guest, your hosts may not let you. Instead, they may invite everyone to move to the living room for dessert with tea or coffee. After an hour or so of general chitchat, it's probably time to head for the door. You don't want to wear out your welcome. And above all,don't go snooping around the house. It's more polite to wait for the host to offer you a guided tour. But except for housewarmings, guests often don't get past the living room.Americans usually like to have advance notice when people come to see them. Only very close friends drop by unannounced. This is especially true if the guests want to stay for a few days. Here's a good ruleof thumb for house guests: Short stays are best. As one 19th century French writer put it, "The first day a man is a guest, the second a burden, the third a pest." Even relatives don't usually stay for several weeks at a time.While you're staying with an Amencan family, try to keep your living area neat and tidy. Your host family will appreciate your consideration.And they may even invite you back!Most Americans consider themselves hospitable people. Folks in the southem United States, m particular, take pride in entertaining guests.In fact,southern hospitality" has become legendary. But in all parts of America, people welcome their guests with open arms. So don't be surprised to find the welcome mat out for you. Just don't forget to wipe your feet.

一位美国朋友邀请你去他家。你以前从未去过美国人的家，你不确定该怎么做。该带一个礼物吗？该怎么穿？该几点到？到了那里该做什么？很高兴你发问。你若是客人，只要使自己感到自在就好了.待客之道就是这样：虽然不是在家里，却使客人有宾至如归之感。是否带礼物的问题常使客人不安。在某些文化中，送主人礼物不只是社交礼节――还是必要的。但是在美国文化中，客人并不一定要带礼物。当然，有些人的确会带个表示感谢的小礼物给他们的主人.一般情况下，可以带花或是糖果．如果这家人有小孩，玩具应当是恰当的礼物。如果你选择不带礼物，不要担心，没有人会注意到的。美国人的待客之道从家里开始――尤其是和食物有关。大多数美国人都同意，无论如何，好的家常菜胜过餐馆的菜。受邀吃饭时，你或许问："我可以带些什么吗？" 除非是每人带道菜的聚餐，否则主人很可能会回答： 不用，你来就可以了. 大多数非正式的聚餐，你应该穿舒适、轻便的衣服。设法准时到，否则打电话告诉主人你会晚点到。用餐时，习惯上，人们会称赞女主人烹调的美食。当然，最大的赞美是多吃!当你吃得差不多时，或许可以主动表示要帮忙清理桌子或洗碗盘，但你既是客人，你的主人可能不会让你这样做。他们或许会邀请大家到客厅吃点心、喝茶或咖啡。聊个大约一小时或许就该离去了，你可不希望变得不受欢迎吧。还有最重要的是不要在屋子里四处窥探，等主人邀请你参观才较有礼貌。可是除了乔迁喜宴之外，客人通常都只待在客厅里。美国人通常喜欢访客事先通知他们，只有非常亲密的朋友才可能不请自来，尤其在客人要待好几天时更是如此。最好不要久留――这是给访客的经验之谈。就像19世纪一位法国作家所写的那样：“第一天是客人，第二天是负担，第三天就是讨厌鬼了."既使是亲戚通常不会一次待上几个星期. 当你住在美国人家里时，设法使你住的地方保持整齐清洁。你的主人_家都会感谢你这么体贴，他们甚至会再邀请你！大多数美国人都认为他们是好客之人。尤其是美国的南方人更以款待客人自豪，事实上，"南方的款待"是人们所津津乐道、口口相传的。不过在美国各地，人们都张开双臂欢迎他们的客人，所以当你发现有WELCOME字样的鞋垫时，不要惊讶，只是别忘了把你的脚擦干净就是了.

"It was the magical qualities these stones which.., transformed the monument and made it a place of pilgrimage for the sick and injured of the Neolithic world," a statement from the archaeologist team said.Geoffrey Wainwright, president of the Society of Antiquaries of London and one of the experts leading the work, told BBC radio that one reason which lead to the conclusion was because anumber of the burials around Stonehenge showed signs of trauma and deformity.The archaeologists said in the statement that radio-carbon dating put the construction of the circle of bluestones at between 2,400 B.C. and 2,200 B.C.,afew centuries later than originally thought, But they found fragments of charcoal dating from before 7,000 B.C., showing humans were active in the area much earlier than previously thought.During the excavation at the World Heritage Site on Salisbury Plain,the researchers also fourtd a beiker pottery fragment, Roman ceramics and ancient stone hammers. "We now know, mucb to our surprise and delight, that Stonehenge was not just prehistoric monument, it was a Roman and mediaeval monument," said Wainwright, Another of the team leaders, Tim Darvill of Boumemouth University , said the bluestones appeared central to the purpose of Stonehenge although it may have had more than one function. Other theories about Stonehenge are that it was a religious site or that it acted as a calendar.

考古学家们于本周一公布，英国最著名的史前遗址巨石阵可能是古代病人的朝圣地。据推测，巨石阵的石头可能被史前人类当作是具有治疗功效的幸运石。长期以来，人们―直很困惑，为什么人们要把巨石阵里的一种蓝色小石头从155英里以外的威尔士普利斯里山运到英格兰南部威尔特郡这里昵？伯恩茅斯大学的考古学家们推测，可能当时的人们信奉这些蓝色的石头具有神奇疗效。考古学家于今年4月对史前巨石阵进行了自1964年以来的首次发掘。该考古小组在一份声明中说：“巨石阵曾经可能只是个纪念碑，但这些具有魔力的石头被搬来之后，这里就变成了新时器时代伤病者的朝圣地。 ” 伦敦古文物学会主席、考古小组专家杰弗里‘韦恩莱特在接受BBC广播的采访时说，得出这一结论的其中一个根据就是，巨石阵附近埋葬了很多伤残者。考古学家在一份声明中说，经放射性碳测年法鉴定，环形巨石阵应该建造于公元前2400年至公元前2200年之间，比之前的推测晚了几百年。但考古学家还在此发现了公元前7000年前的木炭碎片，这说明在更早的时期已有人类活跃在这一地带。考古人员还在发掘过程中发现了大口陶器杯的碎片、古罗马陶器以及古石锤，位于索尔兹伯里平原的史前巨石阵现在已被列入世界文化遗址。韦恩莱特说："现在我们知道了'巨石阵不仅是史前的纪念碑，也是古罗马和中世纪时期的祭坛，这个发现让我们十分惊喜。"考古小组的另一位专家、伯恩茅斯大学的蒂姆・达维尔说，巨石阵可能有多种功能，但蓝色小石头应该是其功能的一个重要体现。其他理论认为，巨石阵曾是个宗教场所或是一个日历等等。

Suprises often come in boxes. Birthday presents wrapped in colorful paper, brown paper packages mailed from a friend. No matter what kind of box it is, people like to open it up and see what's inside. In America, and in many other countries, one special kind of box contains the future. It's called a ballot box. What people put into the box on election day can change the course oflustory.Elections are the lifeblood of a democracy. The word democracy literally means "the people rule", an important concept in America's history. In the mid-1700s, England began passing laws that made the American colorues angry. The colonists had to pay more and more taxes and enjoyed less and less freedom. They felt the govemment of England didn't represent their interests. On July 4, 1776, the colonies declared their independence from England. They wanted to establish a democracy where people could have a voice in government.An effective democracy holds regular elections. In Amcrica, elections are held every two years for members of Congress. In these elections, all seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate seats are up for grabs. In addition, every four years, voters go to the poUs to elect the nation's president and vice-president. Voters also regularly cast their ballots for state and city government leaders and local school board members. Sometimes they also have to vote on a proposed law.In the American electoral system, people don't really vote for presidential c:indldates. Instead, voters cast their ballots for "electors”who support each candidate. Each state has as many electors as the total number of its representatives in Congress. This equals two senators per state plus the number ofits representatives in the House (which is based on the state's population). The candidate who has the most votes in a state wins all of the state's electors.To win the presidentrial election, a candidate must Sain at least 270 0f the 538 total electoral votes.Over the years, the U.S. has made a number of election reforms.Some early reforms outlawed cheating, giving bribes and threatening voters. They also limited the amount of money candidates could receive from donors and spend on theircampaigns. In 1870, black people gained the right to vote, and in 1920, that right was extended to women. In recent decades, laws against unfair rules for voting have been passed.No longer do people have to pay a special tax or pass a test in order to vote.In 1971, the voting age was lowered t0 18. Other reforms made votmg easier for the blind, the disabled and people who couldn't read. In some areas, ballots had to be printed in languages besides English.In November, Americans will again elect those who will represent them in government.Although some citizens aren't even registered to vote-and some registered voters don't bother to go to the polls-most Americans exercise their right to vote. They realize that their future is wrapped up in a special package-the ballot box. It's a package that must definitely be "handled with care".

惊奇常常是在箱子里出现：包在彩色包装纸里面的生日礼物……朋友寄来牛皮纸包的包裹……不论是怎样的箱子，人们喜欢打开来看看里面是什么。在美国以及其他许多国家，有一个特殊的箱子关系着一个国家的未来，它被称为投票箱。人们在选举日投在箱子里的东西可以改变历史的走向。选举是民主的原动力。民主这个字照字面的意思是人民自主竹，是美国历史中一个重要的观念0 18世纪中期，英国开始通过一些使美国殖民地愤怒的法律。殖民地人民必须交付愈来愈多的税，而享有愈来愈少的自由。他们感到英国政府没有代表他们的权益1776年月4日，殖民地宣布从英国独立出去。他们想要建立民主制度，使人们在政府中有发言权。有效的民主制度定期举行选举。在美国，每两年选一次国会议员。在这些选举中，人们可以争取所有众议院的席位和1/3的参议院席位。除此以外，选民每4年要去投票选出国家的总统和副总统。选民也定期投票选出州长、市长及当地学校的董事会成员。有时，他们也必须投票决定提议的法律。在美国的选举制度中，人们并不直接投票给总统候选人，而是由选民给支持各个候选人的"选举"投票。每一州的选举人人数和代表此州的国会议员人数相同，等于每一州的两位参议员加上众议院的众议员人数（以各州的人口为基准）。在一个州里拥有最多票数的候选人就赢得了那一州所有选举人的票数。要赢得总统大选，候选人必须至少获得总共538个选举人中的270张票。多年来，美国在选举方面做了一些改革。早期有些改革禁止作弊、收受贿赂或威胁选民。他们也限制候选人从捐赠者那儿获得的金额数目及花在竞选宣传上的费用.1870年，黑人获得选举权0 1920年，选举权利延伸至妇女那里.近几十年来，通过了一些反对不公平选举规则的法律. 人们不再需要付特殊的税或通过测验才能选举。1971年，投票的年龄降至18岁。其他的改革减轻了盲人、残障者及文盲投票的困难。在某些地区，选票上面除了英文以外，还必须印上别的文字。1 1月5日，美国人要再一次选出在政府中代表他们的人，虽然有些市民甚至不是法定投票人――有些法定投票人懒得去投票―但是大多数的美国人都会行使他们投票的权利。他们了解他们的未来包在一个特别的箱子里――投票箱。它的确是一个必须“小心处理”的箱子。

One of the world's most ancient and historically important trade routes, the Silk Road conjures up exotic images of camel caravans, windswept deserts and such legendary figures as Genghis Khan and Marco Polo. Extending from as far as the Indian kingdoms in the west to present day Xi'an in China in the east, the Silk Road had, by the third centry B.C.,already became a cross roads of Asia.Skirting the edges of the harsh and inhospitable Taklimakan desert, the Silk Road actually had several different branches, each passing through different oasis. All roads began in Chang'an (Xi'an). The northem route wound its way through places such as Turfan and Kuqa before finally ending at Kashgar. Them route followed the lower thnges of the Taklimakan eventually reaching the same destination. Numerous other routes were also plied through out the years, reaching all the way to
Samarkand, Tashkent, India, and the Caspian Sea.Silk was not the only commodity traveling the Silk Road. Other goods such as exotic animals, ivory and gold were also transported along the route. It was silk, though, which fascinated the Romans. Agents were sent from Rome to explore the route and to obtain the material at a lower price. The Romans, however, did not give the Silk Road its name. The term was actuallycoined by the 19th-centuryGerman scholar Baron Ferdinand von Richthofen.Not long after the Tang dynasty era (618-907), when trade along the Silk Road had reached its zenith, the fearsomeGenghis Khan and his Mongol armies conquered a vast area spanning much of Central Asia. Accordingly, the Silk Road became an important communication route between different parts of the Mongol Empire. During the ruleof Kublai,more Europeans began venturing towards China along the Silk Road.The most famous of these travelers was Marco Polo, whose thoughts and
adventures were later recorded and embellished by an Italian romance writer.During the 14th century , with the disintegration of the Mongol Empire, the isolationist policies of the Ming Dynasty and the development of the silk route by sea, the Silk Road was forced into decline. Renewed interest in it emerged among Westem scholars only near the end of the 19th century . The existence of ancient cities excited them, and an archaeological free-for-all began. These days, those seeking out treasures of the Silk Road can find them in such far-flung places as London, Delhi, and Berlin.

世界上最古老、历史上最重要的贸易路线之一_丝绸之路，总给人．种富有异国情调的印象：骆驼商队、狂风肆虐的沙漠，还有诸如成吉思汗和马可波罗等传奇人物。丝绸之路绵亘远长，西至印度王国，东到中国现在的西安，早在公元前3世纪，丝绸之路就已经成为了亚洲交通的十字路口。丝绸之路其实有数条支线，它们分别沿着环境恶劣、不适合人类居住的塔克拉玛干沙漠外缘，穿越不同的绿洲。所有的路线都是始于长安（西安），北线蜿蜒经过了吐鲁番、库车，最后到达喀什格尔，南线沿着塔克拉玛干下缘前行，并到达同一终点。其他的许多支线也是历代都通行的，通往撒玛尔罕、塔什干、印度，及里海等地。丝绸并不是丝绸之路上运送的唯一商品。其他货物如奇珍异兽、象牙，及黄金等也通过丝绸之路运输。不过格外令罗马人着迷的还是丝绸。罗马派遣代理商探测这条路线，并以较低的价格购得丝绸。然而，“丝绸之路”的名称并不是罗马人起的。这个名称是19世纪时一名叫Baron Ferdinand von Richthofen的德国学者首创的。唐代是丝绸之路沿途贸易活动的鼎盛时期，在唐代王朝灭亡后不久，令人闻风丧胆的成吉思汗及其蒙古大军征服了横跨中亚大部分地区的广阔领土。丝绸之路于是成为蒙古帝国各部落间重要的交通线路。忽必烈统治期间，更多的欧洲人冒险沿着丝绸之路来到中国。这些旅行者中最出名的就是马可波罗，他的所见所闻后来被一位意大利传奇小 说家记载下来，并加以润色。14世纪时，蒙古帝国瓦解、明朝实行闭关政策，加“海上丝路”的发展，丝绸之路被迫走向没落。直到近19世纪末，才有西方学者重新燃起了对丝绸之路的兴趣。古城的存在让他们兴奋不已于是掀起了一阵考古热潮。现在，想在丝绸之路寻宝的人们，在伦敦、德里、柏林等许多地方，都可以找到他们想要的东西。

Nestled in the mountains of Bavaria, the fairy-tale castle of Neuschwanstein (New Swan Castle) stands as a king's tribute to the chivalry and magic of a mythical age.The castle was the brainchild of Bavaria's "mad" King Ludwig Inspired by Wagner's operas, the young King Ludwig sought to recreate the legendary dreamworld of medieval knights and heroes. Accordingly,he employed scenic artists, sculptors, and stonemasons to turn that dreamworld into concrete reality .In consultation with Wagner and various theatrical designers, plans for the castle were drawn up and the foundations laid in 1869. No expense was spared. Fourteen sculptors spent four-and-a-half years to complete the wood carvings in the king's bedroom. The floor of the throne room was composed of no fewer than 2 million stones. In all, 15 rooms were completed. Most depict scenes from the king's favorite operas-especially "Lohengrin", the "Swan Knight".Like many an opera, Ludwig's life ended in tragedy. His fascination with castles led government officials to rebel. They accused him of neglecting his duty and forced him to abdicate. The following day,Ludwig was found drowned in six inches of water. But the mad king's unfinished dream lives on-a tribute to a " once upon a time" that never was. It became everyrone's idea of a fairy tale castle, and the prototype for Disney's Castle ofthe Sleeping Beauty.

This house was at first a private residence of a count named'Evreau, hence it was called Hotel d'Evreau. It had later gone through many vicissitudes and its owners had been changed for many times, but all the dwellers in it were distinguished personages and high officials.The house was renamed Bonaparte Mansion when it was owned by Louis 15 and Louis 16 successively when they acted as emperors. Napoleon I signed his act of abdication here when he had suffered crushing defeat in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Napoleon 3 moved in the Mansion in 1848 when he was elected president, and the house became a Royal Palace when he proclaimed himself as emperor. The Third French Republic issued a decreee in 1873, designating officially the Elysee Palace as the residence of president of the French Republic. Over the hundred odd years since then, almost all the president of the French Republic worked and lived there.

As a testament to the correlation between glorious spaces and heavenly thoughts, the Notre Dame de Paris has stood for 750 years as the apex of European religious architecture.Seeking to liberate their creation from the sepulchral atmos of the plague-ridden medieval era, the Notre Dame architects conceived of a design more spacious than that of their predecessors. New developments in arched doorways and supports allowed for thinner outer walls and larger windows, including the famous Rose Windows on the
cathedral's north, south, and west sides.The west window is 9.75 meters in diameter and depicts the infant Jesus surrounded by 16 prophets, 32 0ld Testament kings, and 32 high priests, in concentric circles. With the added light and color provided by these windows, the architects created an ethereal ambience with structural integrity.Since its fundamental completion in 1250, the cathedral has borne witness to many of the significant events of European history, as well as bearing the scars ofits violent periods. It was the scene of the coronahon of Henry VI of England in 1430, and later, that of Mary, Queen of Scots. It survived attempted destruction during the French Revolution to witness the crowning of Napoleon and Josephine. Since then, the Notre Dame de Paris has survived two world wars, and it remains a symbol of European history and resilience.

The lower three provided seating for the spectators and were surrounded by magnificentarcades and 80 perfectly symmetrical arches, each embellished with a statue.The attic story contained brackets wluch could suspend a canopy for shade.In spite of its glorious design, the Colosseum was built largely for the distraction of the masses in a cynical age, providing dramatic and often gruesome entertainments. Armies of slaves fought for their lives in horrific recreations of famous battles. Gladiators fought wild animals and one another to the death in retum for their continued survival, the glory of victory, and precious gifis from their benefactors.These spectacles of gratuitous violence may seem a little annchronistlic, but they are also analogues in many ways to professional sports today, Perhaps the Colosseum is not really such an "ancient" artifact after all.

A little known fact is that Santa Claus does not live at the North Pole, but in the Lapland region of Finland. There, Santa receives about 600,000 letters a year written by children from over 150 countries.Besides dropping in on Santa, visitors to Lapland can enjoy trekking and skiing in Lemmenjoki Park with its dreamlike arctic landscape, dense forests, and free wildeness huts that dot the area. Tourists may also stay in glass igloos, from which they can see the midnight sun and the northem lights, and ride in dogsleds and reindeer sleighs.Lapland is home to the Samis, a native people who were gradually driven northward by development in Scandinavia. Their traditional livelihood revolves around reindeer, which number about 200,000 in Finland. Finally, don't forget, but a great reindeer stew can be had in Lapland as well.

芬兰，一个在午夜可以见到太阳的国家，除了常被人们想到的寒夜、桑拿浴与滑雪之外，它还有更多风格独特的面貌。优雅的城市周边的迷人村庄和欧洲占地最广、未遭人工破坏的荒野，往往令游客们陶醉不已。芬兰是全球最发达的国家之．。例如，其交通罚款的金额视个人总收入而定。最近一名网络巨子就因超速驾驶支付了7万美元的罚单。芬兰也因其高效率和很强的组织力的美誉而主办了许多国际会议。这个现代化的国家仍保留着其传统和蓬勃的朝气，并为许多节日举办庆祝活动。在芬兰最受欢迎的“施洗约翰节”这天，可以看见许多芬兰人在他们自己的乡间农合，点燃篝火，痛快畅饮一番。芬兰也是世界上历史最悠久的摇滚音乐节――“路易斯摇滚”――的主办地。节庆中最富盛名的，首推“沙弗力拿歌剧节”，而最匪夷所思的，则是一年一度的扛老婆大赛，大赛冠军可赢得和老婆雷量相当的啤酒。赫尔辛基，欧洲最北的首都，有30多座美术馆及博物馆。虽然它是芬兰的文化及经济中心，但因其为数众多的咖啡馆和罕见的高楼大厦，而让人感受到小镇般的迷人风情。尽管这里的公共运输远近驰名，但遍布赫尔辛基的自行车道，使在城市和海滨公园骑车驰骋，成为一件轻松惬意的事。参观过市场广场和用坚石砌成的“岩石教堂”等雄伟建筑后，游客们可能也想二探赫尔辛基自由奔放的艺术景观。其高雅与通俗文化交汇在坦尼斯宫的博物馆与电影院，而现代艺术的爱好者也会乐于一游拉撤官里“玻璃官竹的媒体中心。另一个丕容错过的景点是邻近的“苏欧门里那岛”，在那儿你可以徘徊流连于海洋要塞的古老遗迹塑参观多座博物馆。建于1280年的土尔库堡，离赫尔辛基仅数小时之遥，是芬兰最著名的史迹建筑。虽然芬兰在暖和的5～9月间气候景为宜人，二位最负盛名的芬兰居民则在12月最为忙碌。一个罕为人知的事实是圣诞老人并非住在北极，而是住在芬兰的拉普兰一带。在那里，圣诞老人每年会收到来自世界上1 50多个国家的孩子寄来的约60万封信。除了顺道拜访圣诞老人，前往拉普兰的游客也可以在拉门乔基公园享受徒步旅行与滑雪之乐，并欣赏它如梦似幻的北极圈风光、蓊郁的森林以及这片辽阔荒原上星罗棋布的小屋。游客们也可以呆在玻璃冰屋内观赏午夜的太阳和北极极光，或是乘坐狗或驯鹿拉的雪橇畅游一番。拉普兰是撒密斯人的故乡，这些土著居民由于斯堪的纳维亚半岛的开发而被迫逐渐向北迁徙。他们传统的生计是靠芬兰国内的大约20万只驯鹿。最后，别忘了，在拉普兰你还可以尝到很棒的炖驯鹿大餐呢。

Scotland is a unique and austere place, laden with history, where you can find aristocrafic palaces and castles, as well as the traditional parades in national costumes. It has some of the most beautiful cities in Europe, a living testimony of a proud and splendid past.In order to see and discover the true soul of Scotland today, what forged the character of this splendid region, we have to go towards the northern regions, to the Grampian Mountains. Beautiful and unspoiled,it was difficult to farm. The Scots subdued the environment with simple spades and strong arms,The history of this ancient struggle, and its people's ancient love affair with the hard land, is enclosed within the walls of the Angus Folk Museum. You are able to get a feel ofthe t3rpical rural atmosphere of times past from the everyday artifacts displayed here,From coastal Aberdeen in towards the interior of the Grampian Mountains there runs the Castle Trail, a road that touches on many fortresses, which are witnesses of continual revolts against the dominion of neighboring England in Scottish history.Perhaps the most uplifting moment for Scottish autonomy is the experienced inside this ancient abbey ofArbroath, where, in 1320, the Declarahon oflndependence was celebrated, at the instigation of King Bruce. He carried out the plan for autonomy drawn up by the great popular hero William Wallace, to whom cmema has dedicated the wonderful film "Braveheart', the winner offive Oscars.This is Glamis Castle. It is often remembered for being the residence of King Macbeth and Queen Elizabeth in her childhood. Among the most assiduous guests here are the inevitable ghosts, which are nourished,ifnot actually created, by ancient popular beliefs, These have been handed down over the centuries by a people inclined to live with mystery , with the forces ofthe supernatural。Another attraction here is a legendary monster: the Loch Ness Monster. Is it real or imaginary, this monster, which has been nicknamed Nessie, has collected a good 3000 sightings over the last 50 years? To fuel the debate about the monster, and perhaps also curiosity about the lake, a price of 500,000 pounds sterling has been put on Nessie's head.The true flag of Scotland, tartan, is recognisable from the brightly coloured plaid pattems which are used to distinguish the various clans. Over the last few decades this fabric has made a comeback and is part of the daily life of this country.The trpical Scottish garment, the kilt, is de rigeur when the Scots play the Great Highland bagpipes, especially when they march in parades.Bagpipes and dancing open the competitions oflocal sporting events,which are called Highland Gatherings. The games, which have strange rules, involve a spirit that has more to do with brute force than with athletics.

苏格兰是一个独特的地方，自然条件虽不算得天独厚，历史的厚重感却随处可见。豪门望族的府第与城堡历历在目，仪仗队的士兵也还穿着传统服装。这里有全欧洲最美的城市，它们诉说着苏格兰昔日的荣光。想看看真正的苏格兰，追寻这里民族精神的源泉，就得去北部的格兰扁山区。格兰扁山区景色怡人没有受到现代文明的污染，这里―度不适合耕作，而倔强的苏格兰人，凭着铁锹和双手征服了这片土地，苏格兰先民的艰苦劳作与他们自古对这片贫瘠土地的眷恋，在这个安格斯大众博物馆里一览无余。这里展出的都是平常的物品，营造出往日乡间的氛围，使人油然而生怀旧之情。从沿海的阿伯丁有一条古堡之路，它一直蜿蜒到格兰扃山区深处。沿途很多昔日的要塞，都是苏格兰在历史上不断反抗英格兰统治的见证。苏格兰争取自治的过程中最大快人心的时刻莫过于1320年在这个阿尔伯罗斯修道院里，布鲁斯国王鼓动百姓大肆庆贺独立宣言的签订。布鲁斯采纳传奇英雄威廉・华勒斯所献的计策，完成了自治大业，这个故事后来被改编成电影（（勇敢的心》，该片曾摘取了5项奥斯卡奖。苏格兰的另一大景点是格来米斯城堡，这座城堡之所以名闻遐迩，是因为曾经的两位主人――苏格兰国王麦克白与幼年时的伊丽莎白女王。(4)如今这里最殷勤的客人当数传说中挥之不去的幽灵，这些传说即使不是源于世代相传的民间故事，也大有受其启发之嫌疑。苏格兰人似乎生来就笃信超自然的力量，因此才有了这些传说。这里吸引游人的另一个原因则是尼斯湖的怪兽。真假姑且不论，这个呢称为Nessie的怪兽在过去的半个世纪中已经吸引了3000余名游客。如今它头上有50万英镑的悬赏，使得学术界的争论日益激烈，或许这也是为了增强游人的好奇心吧。苏格兰格子呢是苏格兰真正的旗帜。它显著的花格子图案曾经是区分不同宗族的标志。在过去几十年里，格子呢在苏格兰再度流行，如今则已在日常生活中不可或缺。苏格兰传统的褶裙按照礼节是应该在演奏高地风笛时穿的，尤其是在列队前进的时候。高地风笛与利尔舞揭开了高地运动盛会的序幕。运动会的比赛项目规则奇特，与其说是田径比赛，不如说是大力士的较量。

Antarctica is the highest, driest, and coldest place on Earth. It is also the remotest, a fact which accounts for its unspoUed environment. It is difficultforpeople to get there, and not a comfortable place for people to stay once they arrive. It is widely described as the last true wilderness on our planet.The Antarctic continent has mountain ranges similar in size to the European Alps. But whereas the Alps' snowcaps are just deep enough for skiing, Antarctic mountains are swallowed up by their caps, and lie buried beneath an ice sheet that is five kilometers thick.The cold climate is responsible for maintaining the continent's year round ice fields: They never melt. Even though Antarctica receives more sunlight than the equator, the temperatures are lower because the ice sheet reflects the heat back into space. Thus, the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was in Antarctica in July, 1983: Soviet scientists shivered through temperatures that fell to minus 89.2 degrees Celsius.For centuries, Europeans wondered about the existence of a South Polar continent, but no one actually knew for certain Antarctica was there until 1820 when European explorers "discovered" it. Since then, men have gone to Antarctica in search of adventure. Testing their abilities, several teams of explorers set out in 1911 to be the first men to stand at the South Pole. Norwegian Roald Amundsen and his men reached the pole; so did Robert F. Scott, an Englishman, but he and his team died on the return trip.Once completely inaccessible, Antarctica has more recently been playing host to adventurers seeking excitement, scientists interested in experimenting, and companies looking to exploit this wild terrain for profit.gold, uranium, and oil are just some of the valuable resources which lie beneath the continent's icy covering.Though no human population is native to Antarctica, about l,000 people work there in the summer months, and another 12,000 tourists visit every year. They come to enjoy the unspoiled environment, the bright blue skies, and the fresh white snow fields.If a tourist is lucky enough, he or she can join an expedition to see some of the continent's other residents. Animals along the coast of the Southem Ocean don't mind the cold weather, and thrive in Antaraica's seas. Penguins and seals breed on the icy shores and fish for krill in the cool water.Yet, Antarctica's fragile and complicated ecosystem is threatened by its human visitors.Damage to the environment occurs as people come looking for resources beneath the ice, or carelessly leave their garbage behind. Currently, countries are working to ensure that the damage to Antarctica's environment is minimized, and that the last wilderness on Earth will remain an unspoiled place.

南极洲是地球上最高、最千和最冷的地方。它也是最偏僻的，这就解释了南极洲为什么会成为一片没被污染的环境。人们很难到达那儿，即使到了那里，南极洲也不是个能让人呆得舒适的地方。它被普遍形容为我们星球上的最后一片真正的荒野。南极大陆的山脉覆盖的面积与欧洲的阿尔卑斯山差不多。不过阿尔卑斯山顶积雪的深度仅够滑雪，南极大陆的山脉却被积雪吞噬，深埋在厚达5公里的冰层下。寒冷的气候使南极冰厚得可以常年维持：它们永不融化。虽然南极洲的光照比赤道多，气温却比它低，因为冰层能将热能反射回天空。因此，地球上的最低温度记录就是出现在1983年7月的南极洲,前苏联科学家在降至摄氏零下89.2度的低温中瑟瑟发抖。几个世纪以来，欧洲人_直在猜测是否存在南极洲，直到1820年欧洲的探险家“发现”了它，人们才真正确定南极洲的存在。从那以后，人们开始去南极洲探险。1911年，几支探险队为了验证自己的能力便出发去南极洲，希望能成为站在南极极点的先锋。挪威人罗德・阿蒙森和队友抵达了极点。英国人罗伯特。F．斯科特也做到了'不过他和他的队友却在回程中不幸丧生。曾经遥不可及的南极洲，近来却开始接待寻求刺激的冒险家、有兴趣做实验的科学家和打算开发这片荒原获利的公司。黄金、铀和石油只不过是埋藏在南极冰层下宝贵资源中的几种而已。虽然南极洲没有土著居民，但每年夏季的几个月里，约有1000人在那儿工作，另外每年还有约12000名游客来此参观。他们到南极来享受没有污染的环境、碧蓝的天空和皓洁的雪原。如果游客够幸运的话，他（她）还可以加入探险队一睹南极大陆上的其他生物。南太平洋沿岸的动物不介意严寒的气候，它们在南极海域中繁衍生息。企鹅和海豹则在结冰的海岸上繁衍后代，并在冰冷的海水中捕捉磷虾。不过，南极洲脆弱而复杂的生态系统正受到游客的威胁。人们来这儿寻找冰层下的自然资源，或不经意的留下垃圾，都会对环境造成污染。目前，各国正努力将对南极洲环境的破坏降到最低，以确保地球上的最后―片荒野能永远是一块未受破坏的地方。

Baghdad, Iraq, came last despite slight improvements in its infrastructure and moves to encourage investment. Three German cities made the top 10 Dusseldorf, Munich and Frankfurt with the list rounded out by Bem in Switzerland and Sydney, Australia. The highest U.S. rankang in the 2009 Worldwide Quality of Living Survey was Horiolulu which came 29th while Washington and New York remained in positions 44 and 49 respectively. London came 38th in the list which is designed to help governments and companies formulate intemational packages for their employees。"As a result of the current financial crisis multinationals are looking to review their intemational assignment policies with a view to cutting costs," said Slagin Parakatil, senior researcher at Mercer, in a statement."Many companies plan to reduce the number of medium to long term international assignments and localize their expatriate compensahon packages where possible though the hardship allowance, based on quality of living criteria, will remain an essential component of the package."Singapore was the topscoring Asian city, coming in 26th which was up six places from a year ago due to its growing importance as a financial center and its wide range of intemational and private schools. Beijing moved up three places to 113, boosted by improvements in public transport facilities from Olympics last August.

Ah, beautiful Paris. For centuri es this city has attracted the admiration of the world. The allure and charm of Paris captivate all who visit there.Where can you discover the charm of Paris for yourseIf. Is it in the legacy of all the French rulers who worked to beautify their beloved city? Is it in the famous castles, palaces, statues and monuments? Can you it in the world-class museums, such as the Louvre? Perhaps Paris' allure lies in the zest and style of the Parisians.When you visit Paris, you don't have to spend all of your time visiting museums and monuments. They are certainly worthy of your time, but ignore them for a day. First take some time to look around and experience life in Paris. You'll find it charming.Take a stroll along the Seine River. Browse through the art vendors colorful paintings. Peek through delicate iron gates at the well kept gardens. Watch closely for the French attention to detail that has made France synonymous with good taste. You will see it in the design of a doorway or arch and in the little fountains and quaint balconies. No matter where you look,you will find everyday objects transformed into works by art.Spend some time in a quiet park relaxing on an oid bench. Lie on your back on the green grass. When you need refreshment, try coffee and pastries at a sidewalk cafe. Strike up a conversation with a Parisian. This isn't always easy, though. With such a large international population living in Paris, true natives are hard to find these days.As evening comes to Paris, enchantment rises with the mist over the riverfront. You may hear music from an outdoor concert nearby classical, jazz, opera or chansons, those French folk songs. Parisians love their music. The starry sky is their auditorium. You can also hear concerts in the chateaux and cathedrals. In Paris the Music never ends.Don't miss the highlight of Paris evening: eating out. Parisians are proud of their cuisine. And rightly so; it's world famous. Gourmet dining is one of the indispensable joys ofliving. You need a special guidebook to help you choose one of the hundreds of excellent restaurants. The capital of France boasts every regional specialty, cheese and wine the country has to offer. If you don't know what to order, ask for the suggested menu. The chef likes to showcase his best dishes there. Remember, you haven't tasted the true flavor ofFrance until you've dined at a French restaurant in Paris.After your gourmet dinner, take a walking tour of the floodlit monuments. Cross the Pont Neuf, the oldest bridge in the city. The most famous landmark of Paris looms up in front of you the Notre Dame Cathedral (Cathedral of Our Lady). Stand in the square in front of the cathedral. Here, you are standing in the center of France. All distances are measured from the front of Notre Dame. Every road in France leads to her front door. All French kings and leaders have journeyed here to commemorate important occasions and give thanks. Notre Dame is the heart ofParis and the heart of France.Your visit in Paris has only just begun. You've just started to discover the charm ofthis old city. May the rest of yourjoumey be unforgettable. When it is time to leave, you will go reluctantly.

啊，美丽的巴黎！几个世纪以来，这个城市赢得了整个世界的崇拜。巴黎的诱惑与魅力吸引了所有到此游玩的人。你在哪里可以找到巴黎对你的吸引力呢？是否是在历任的法国统治者们在美化他们所钟爱的城市时所留下来的遗产里？还是在那些有名的城堡、皇宫、雕像和纪念碑里呢？你能否在世界一流的博物馆，例如卢浮宫中找着呢？或许巴黎的诱惑力在于巴黎人的特殊品味和风格。当你到巴黎游玩时，别把时间全都花在看博物馆和纪念碑上面。它们当然很值得你花时间去参观，但今天先忘掉它们。首先来四处看看，并体验―下巴黎的生活。你会在其中发现它的迷人之处的。沿着塞纳河漫步吧。浏览艺术家们丰富色彩的绘画，透过那些精致的铁门，向内偷窥那些精心照看的花园。仔细留心法国人对于细节的留意，这使得法国成为“好品味”的同义词。你可以在门廊或拱门以及小喷泉和古怪有趣的走廊的设计上发现这一点。不管你往哪里看，你都会觉得日常物品已经变成了艺术品。花些时间，在一个安静的公园里面的旧板凳上轻松地休息或是躺在青草地上。想吃点心的时候，尝尝路边咖啡店的咖啡及点心。你也可以找一个巴黎人展开一段会话，但这也不太容易，有这么大的国际人口居住在此地，要找到一个真正当地的巴黎人是很难的。到了傍晚时分，随着码头上雾气的升起，巴黎的诱惑力也随之而起。你也会听到附近室外音乐会所演奏的乐曲，其中包括古典乐、爵士乐、歌剧或是香颂即法国的民歌。巴黎人热爱自己的音乐，繁星点缀的天空，就是他们演奏的大礼堂。你也可以在城堡或教堂里聆听音乐会。在巴黎，音乐是不会停止的。不要错过了巴黎的夜生活中最重要的一部分：下馆子。巴黎人对其烹饪非常骄傲，他们理当如此，因为它世界驰名。美食本来就是与生活享乐不可分割的。为了帮你从几百家绝佳的餐厅中作选择，你需要―本特别的指南。法国的首都以各地的特色风味、乳酪和酒著称于世，如果你不知道要点什么，可以要“推荐菜单”来看。大厨喜欢在此将他最拿手的菜作一番橱窗展示。请记住，在你尚未在巴黎的法国餐厅里吃过饭之前，都不算尝过法国真正的风味。在你的美食晚餐之后，可以到被聚光灯照耀的纪念碑去走一趟。穿过(Pont Neuf)这个城市中最古老的桥――第九桥，你将到达城市之岛(Ile de la Cite)，此时巴黎最有名的标志――圣母院会隐约地呈现在你的面前。站在教堂前面的广场，此时你也正处于法国的正中心，因为所有的距离皆是以圣母院前门开始计算，法国的每一条路都通往它的前门。所有的法国国王或统治者都曾经旅游到此来纪念重要的节日或感恩。圣母院是巴黎的中心，也是法国的中心。你的巴黎之旅才刚刚开始呢。你才刚刚开始发现这个古老城市的魅力。希望你剩余的旅程将令你难以忘怀。当你该起程回家时，你会依依不合。然后用法文说道：后会有期，巴黎！

Scientists unveiled on Sunday the first direct evidence that massive floods deep below Antarctica's ice cover are accelerating the flow of glaciers into the sea.How quickly these huge bodies of ice slide off the Antarctic and Greenland land masses into the ocean help determine the speed at which sea levels rise.The stakes are enormous: An increase measured in tens of centimeters could wreak bavoc for hundreds of millions of people living in low-lying deltas and island nations around the world.Researchers discovered only recently that inaccessible subglacial lakes in Antarctica periodically shed huge quantities of water.Data collected by a satellite launched in 2003-the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite, or ICESat-revealed a complex network of subglacial plumbing in which water periodically cascades from one hidden reservoir to another.But the new study, published online in the joumal Nature Geoscience, is the first to measure the potential impact ofthis invisible fiooding on sea bound glaciers.A trio of scientists led by Steams of the Climate Change Insttute at the University of Maine matched ICESat data against a nearly 50-year record of how fast the Byrd Glacier in East Antarctica has moved toward the sea.They discovered that during the same 14-month period that l.7 cubic km of water cascaded through subglacial waterways, the 75-km long glacier downstream pick up speed, moving about 10 percent faster."Our findings provide direct evidence that an active lake drainage system can cause large and rapid changes in glacier dynamics," the researchers concluded."Water acts as a lubricant, reducing friction at the base of the ice and making ice flow faster," explained Helen Fricker of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of California in a commentary, also in Nature Geoscience.The study adds to growing scientific concern about the pace at which glaciers are melting into the seas.

科学家于上周日首次公布资料，证明南极冰层下的大规模水流正加速冰川流向海洋。这些体积庞大的冰川正从南极大陆和格陵兰岛漂向海洋，它们漂移的速度直接决定了海平面升高的速度。这导致的后果将触目惊心：海平面升高几十厘米就足以威胁居住在地势较低的三角洲及岛国地区的亿万人民的生存。研究人员最近发现，南极冰层下隐秘的湖泊会发生周期性的倾泻。美国宇航局2003年发射的“冰云和地面高度卫星”(ICESat)收集的数据显示，南极冰层下有一个复杂的湖泊排水网络，湖水会周期性地从一个隐秘的湖泊流向另一个湖泊。而这项最新研究则首次估量了海洋冰川下隐秘水流的潜在影响，该研究成果在<自然地学》期刊的网络版上发表。以美国缅因州大学气候变化学院的斯特恩斯为首的3位科学家将卫星数据与南极东部的伯德冰川在过去近50年中移向海洋的速度进行了对比。通过比较，研究人员发现，在14个月的时间中，冰层下的湖泊溢出了1.7立方千米的水，75公里长的伯德冰川的移动速度加快了10%。研究人员由此得出结论：“活跃的湖泊排水系统会导致冰川运动出现大规模、快速的变化，我们的研究结果为此提供了直接的证据。”加州斯克里普斯海洋学研究所的海伦・弗里克在一篇科学评论中解释说：“水可以起到润滑剂的作用，减少了冰层底部的摩擦，所以加速了冰川的流动。”她的这篇文章也在《自然地学》期刊上发表。该研究进一步加剧了科学家对冰川融化速度的担忧。

There was a rich merchant who had 4 wives. He loved the 4th wife the most and adorned her with rich robes and treated her to delicacies. He took great care ofher and gave her nothing but the best. He also loved the 3rd wife very much. He's very proud of her and always wanted toshow off her to his friends.However, the merchant is always in great fear that she might run away with some other men. He too, loved his 2nd wife. She is a ver3r considerate person, always patient and in fact is the merchant's confidante. Whenever the merchant faced some problems, he always turnedto his 2nd wife and she would always help him out and tide him through dimcult times. Now, the merchant's lst wife is a very loyal partner and has made great contributions in maintaining liis wealth and business as well as taking care of the household. However, the merchant did not love the first wife and although she loved him deeply, he hardly took notice of her. One day, the merchant fell ill. Before long, he knew that he was going to die soon. He thought ofhis luxurious life and told himself, "Now I have 4 wives with me. But when I die, I'll be alone. How lonely I'll be!" Thus, he asked the 4th wife, "I loved you most, and owed you with the finestclothingand showered great care over you.Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?" "No way!" replied the 4th wife and she walked away without another word. The answer cut like a sharp knife right into the merchant's heart. The sad merchant then asked the 3rd wife, 'I have loved you so much for all my life. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?" "No!" replied the 3rd wife. "Life is so good over here! I'm going to remarry when you die!" The merchant's heart sank and turnedcold. He then asked the 2nd wife, “I always tumed to you for help and you've always helped me out. Now I need your help again. When I die, will you follow me and keep me company?" "I'm sorry,'I can't help you out this time!" replied the 2nd wife. "At the very most, I can only send you to your grave." The answer came like a bolt ofthunder and the merchant was devastated. Then a voice called out: I leave with you. I'll follow you no matter where you go." The merchant looked up and there was his first wife. She was so skinny, almost like she suffered from malnutrihon. Greatly grieved, the merchant said, "I should haye taken much better care of you while I could have!"Actually, we all have 4 wives in our lives. The 4th wife is our body.No matter how much time and effort we lavish in making it look good,it'll leave us when we die. Our 3rd wife is our possessions, status and wealth. When we die, they aU go to others. The 2nd wife is our family and friends. No matter how close they had been there for us when we're alive, the furthest they can stay by us is up to the grave. The lst wife is in fact our soul,neglected in our pursuit of material, wealth and sensual pleasure. Guess what? It is actually the only thing that follows us wherever we go. Perhaps it's a good idea to cultivate and strengthen it now rather than to wait until we're on our deathbed to lament.

从前，一位富有的商人娶了4个老婆。他最爱他的小老婆，并给她华丽的衣裳和美味佳肴。他对她体贴人微，把最好的东西都给了她。商人也很爱第3个老婆。他为她感到骄傲，并常把她作为在朋友面前炫耀的资本。但他同时也忧心忡忡，怕她与其他男人跑掉了。当然，商人也爱第2个老婆，她既善解人意又有耐心。事实上，她是商人的红颜知己。每每遇到困难，他就会找她，而她也总能帮助他走出困境、渡过难关。至于大老婆，她是一位忠诚的伴侣，替他照料生意、打理家务，忙里忙外，可谓劳苦功高。然而，尽管她爱得这么深，商人却偏不钟情于她，甚至没把她放在心上。一日，商人得了重病，他自知将不久人世。他回顾了自己奢华的一生，不禁心中怅然：“现在我虽然有4个老婆相伴，但死后却要孤零零―人。多寂寞啊！”于是，他问小老婆：“我最疼你，给你买最漂亮的衣服，还对你呵护备至.现在我就要离开这个世界了，你愿意随我而去，与我相伴吗？”“绝不可能！"她丢下一句话，径自走开了。小老婆的回答如一把尖刀插在商人心上。伤心的商人继而问第3个老婆：“我―直对你宠爱有加。如今，我将不久于人世，你愿意随我而去，与我相伴吗？”“不！”她拒绝道，人间的生活多么美好啊！你死后我会改嫁他人！”商人的心倏地下沉，渐渐变冷。他再转向第2个老婆，问道：“我过去常常求助于你，你也总能为我排忧解难。现在我想再请你帮一次忙。我死后，你愿意随我而去，与我相伴吗？竹“很抱歉，这一次我帮不了你，”她说，“我最多只能让你人士为安。”这句话犹如晴天霹雳，商人彻底绝望了．这时，旁边传来一个声音：“我愿意随你．同离去。无论你到哪里，我都会跟着你。”商人抬起头，看到了自己的大老婆。她是那么消瘦，一副营养不良的样子。商人悲痛万分，他说：“我过去就应该好好地珍惜你啊！”其实，我们每个人的一生都有4位爱人相伴。小老婆代表我们的躯体。无论我们花费多少的时间和精力想去装扮她，我们死后它终会弃我们而去。第3位老婆代表财产、地位与金钱。一旦我们撒手西去，它终究会转向他人。第2个老婆则代表了我们的家人与朋友。我们活着的时候，无论他们与我们多么亲近，他们最多也只能到墓前送我们最后一程。至于大老婆，她则是我们的灵魂。当我们沉迷于追求物质、金钱或感官享受的时候，她常常会被遗忘在一旁。结果呢？她才是唯一与我们永远相伴的。也许从现在开始，我们就应该悉心照顾好她，而不是等到临终之际才悔恨不已。

We lived on the banks of the Tennessee River, and we owned the summers when we were girls. We ran wild through humid srumner days that never ended but only melted one into the other. We floated down rivers of weekdays with no school, no rules, no parents, and no constructs other than our fantasies. We were good girls, my sister and We had nothing to rebel against. This was just life as we knew it, and we knew the summers to be long and to be ours.The road that ran past our house was a one-lane rural route. Every monung, after our parents had gone to work, I'd wait for the mail lady to pull up to our box. Some days I would put enough change for a few stamps into a mason jar lid and I eave it in the mailbox. I hated bothering mail lady with this transaction, which made her job take longer. But I liked that she knew that someone in our house sent letters into the outside world.I liked walking to the mailbox in my bare feet and leaving footprints on the dewy grass. I imagined that feeling the wetness on the bottom of my feet made me a poet. I had never read poetry, outside of some Emily Dickinson. But I imagined that people who knew of such things would walk to their mailboxes through the moming dew in their bare feet.We planned our weddings with the help of Barbie dolls and the tiny purple wildflowers growing in our side yard. We became scientists and tested concochons of milk, orange juice, and mouthwash. We ate handfuls of bittersweet chocolate chips and licked peanut butter off spoons. When we ran out of sweets to eat, we snitched sugary Flintstones vitamins out of the medicine cabinet. We became masters of the Kraftt macaroni and checse lunch, and we dutifully called our mother at work three times a day to give her updates on our adventures. But don't call too often or speak too loudly or whine too much, we told ourselves, or else they'll get annoyed and she'll get fired and the summers will end.We shaped our days the way we chose, far from the prying eyes of adults. We found our dad's Playboys and charged the neighborhood boys money to look at them. We made crank calls around the county, telling people they had won a new car. "What kind?" they'd ask. "Red," we'd always say. We put on our mom's old prom dresses, complete with gloves and hats, and sang backup to the C.W. McCall song convoy, which we'd found on our dad's turntable.We went on hikes into the woods behind our house, crawling under barbed wire fences and through tangled undergrowth. Heat and humidity found their way through the leaves to our flushed faces. We waded in streams that we were always surprised to come across. We walked past cars and auto parts that had been abandoned in the woods, far from any road. We'd reach the tree line and come out unexpectedly into a cow pasture. We'd perch on the gate or stretch out on the large flat limestone out crop that marked the end of the Woods Behind Our House. One day a thunderstorm blew up along the Tennessee River. It was one of those storms that make the day go dark and the humidity disappear. First it was still and quiet. There was electricity in the air and then the sharp crispness of a summer day being blown wide open as the winds rushed in. We threw open all the doors and windows. We found the classical radio station from two towns away and tumed up the bass and cranked up the speakers. We let the wind blow in and churn our summer day around. We let the music we were only vaguely familiar with roar through the house. And we twirled. We twirled in the living room, in the wind and in the music. We twirled and we imagined that we were poets and dancers and scientists and spring brides.We twirled and imagined that if we could let everything the thunder, the storm, the wind , the world-into that house in the banks of the Tennessee River, we could live in our summer dreams forever. When we were girls.

在我们还是小女孩的时候，夏天是我们的，那时，我们家住在田纳西河畔。在那些永无尽头、一天天彼此交融的湿润夏日里，我们撒了野地跑着。我们在长长的日子中放任着自己，没有学校的管束、没有规则的羁绊、没有父母的训诫、没有既定的观念，只有属于我们自己的梦幻。我和姐姐，我们都是好女孩，那些日子里没有什么需要我们去对抗和反叛的。这就是我们所知的生活，我们知道夏日正长，而且是属于我们的。我家门前的那条路是一条单车道的乡间小路。每天早上父母上班以后，我会等着女邮差把车停在我们的信箱跟前。有时候，我会在大口玻璃瓶的瓶盖里放上够买几张邮票的零钱，再把它放在信箱里面。我讨厌为这样的交易去麻烦女邮差，这会延长她的工作时间。但我喜欢让她知道我们家里也有人寄信到外面的世界。我喜欢赤足走向我家的信箱，在沾着露水的草地上留下脚印。我想像着，足底湿漉漉的感觉使我成了一个诗人。除了艾米莉・狄金森的一些作品外，我其实从不读诗。但是我想，懂得这类东西的人_定会赤足踏着晨露走向他们的信箱。我们用芭比娃娃和旁边小花园里紫色的小野花来筹办我们的婚礼游戏。我们是尝试将牛奶、橙汁和漱口水混合在一起的科学家。我们吃光一把又一把甜中带苦的巧克力片，并把勺子上的花生酱舔得干干净净。糖果吃完了，我们就从药箱里偷拿有甜味的弗林斯通复合维生素。我们成了用卡夫通心面和干酪烹制午餐的专家，并尽职尽责地每天给正在上班的妈妈打3个电话汇报我们的最新情况。但是，我们告诫自己：不要打太多电话，不要说得太大声，也不要在电话里过多地诉苦，要不然他们就会生气，妈妈就会被解雇，美好的夏日也就完结了。远离大人们窥视的目光，我们按自己选择的方式安排着生活。我们找出了爸爸的（（花花公子）》杂志，让邻家的男孩们付费观看。我们给全县各地的人打神秘电话，对他们说他们赢得了一辆新车。“什么样的？”他们会问。而我们总是回答：“红的。”我们穿上妈妈在班级舞会上穿的旧礼服，配上手套和帽子，并伴唱着在爸爸的唱机上找到的麦考尔的《护卫队》这首歌。我们到屋后的树林里远足，从带刺的铁丝篱墙下爬过，穿过缠绕纠结的灌木丛。热气和湿气透过树叶的罅隙扑上我们绯红的脸颊。每次我们总是会意外地遇到溪流，于是我们就在其中涉水而行。我们走过被丢弃在远离大路的林中的轿车和汽车部件。我们会―直走到树林边上，结果意外地走进一个奶牛场。我们会倚坐在门上休息，或者摊开四肢躺在露出地面的又大又平的石灰岩上。这些岩石标志着“屋后树林”的尽头。有一天，田纳西河沿岸出现了暴风雨。这样的暴风雨让天空变得阴沉起来，同时也驱走了湿气。刚开始，一切宁静又安详。一会儿功夫， 空气中孕含着电流，乍起的风把夏日的清爽吹得豁然大开。我们敞开所有的门窗，把收音机调到两个镇子之外的古典音乐台，加重低音并把音量开得大大的。我们让风吹进来，让它肆意搅动着我们的夏日。我们让似曾相熟的音乐在屋子里轰鸣，我们则在一边随着音乐飞快地旋转。在客厅中、在风中、在音乐里，我们飞旋着，想象自己是诗人、是舞者、是科学家、是春天里的新娘。我们飞旋着，想象要是能让一切――雷声、暴风雨、狂风以至整个世界――旋人田纳西河畔的那座房子，我们就能永远活在我们的夏日之梦里。那时，我们还是小女孩。

When he told me he was leaving I felt like a vase which has just smashed. There were pieces of me all over the tidy, tan tiles. He kept talking, telling me why he was leaving, explaining it was for the best, I could do better, it was his fault and not mine. I had heard it before many times and yet somehow was still not immune; perhaps one did not become immune to such blow.He left and I tried to get on with my life, I filled the kettle and put it on to boil, I took out my old red mug and filled it with coffee watching as each coffee granule slipped in to the mug. That was what my life had been like, endless omissions of coffee granules, somehow never managing to make that cup of coffee.Somehow when the kettle piped its finishing waming I pretended not to hear it. That's what Mike's leaving had been like, sudden and with an awful finality. I would rather just wallow in uncertainty than have things finished.I laughed at myself. Imagine geffing all philosophical and sentimental about a mug of coffee. I must be getting old.And yet it was a young woman who stared back at me from the mirror. A young woman full of promise and hope, a young woman with bright eyes and full lips just waiting to take on the world. I never loved Mike anyway. Besides there are more important things. More important than love, I insist to myselffirmly. The lid goes back on the coffee just like closure on the whole Mike experience.He doesn't haunt my dreams as I feared that night. Instead I am flying far across fields and woods, looking down on those below me.Suddenly I fall to the ground and it is only when I wake up that I realize I was shot by a hunter, brought down by the burden of not the bullet but the soul of the man who shot it. I realize later, with some degree of understanding, that Mike was the hunter holding me down and I am the bird that longs to fly. The next rught my dream is similar to the previous
nights, but without the hunter.I fly free until I meet another bird who flies with me in perfect harmony. I realize with some relief that there is a bird out there for me, there is another person, not necessarily a lover perhaps just a friend, but there is someone out there who is my soul mate. I think about being a broken vase again and realize that I have glued myself back together, what Mike has is merely a little part of my time in earth, a little understanding of my physicalbeing. He has only, a little piece ofme.

They spoke of their wives and families, their homes, their jobs, their involvement in the military anda whole lot of things. Every afternoon, when the man in the bed by the window could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window.The man in the other bed began to live for those one hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the activity and color ofthe world outside.The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake. Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every color and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance.As the man by the window described all this in exquisite detail, the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine the picturesque scene.One warm aftemoon, the man by the window described a parade passing by. Although the other man couldn't hear the band he could see it in his mind's eye as the gentleman by the window pojrtrayed it with descriptive words.Days and weeks passed. one morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for theirbaths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away.As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone.Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside. He strained to slowly tum to look out the window beside the bed.

She said, "Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you."

He was 11 years old and went fishing every chance he got from dock at his family's cabin on an island in the middle ofa Nes Hanpshire lake.On the day before the bass season opened, he and his father were fishing early in the evening, catching sunfish and perch with worms. Then he tied on a small silver lure and practiced casting. The lure struck the water and caused colored ripples in the sunset, then silver ripples as the moon rose over the lake.When his pole doubled over, he knew something huge was on the other end. His father watched with admiration as the boy skillfully worked the fish alongside the dock.Finally, he very gingerly lifted the exhausted fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a bass.The boy and his father looked at the handsome fish, gills playing back and forth in the moonlight. The father lit a match and looked at his watch. It was 10 P.M-two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy."You'll have to put it back, son," he said."Dad!" cried the boy."There willbe other fish," said his father."Not as big as this one," cried the boy.He looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were anywhere around in the moonlight. He looked again at his father.Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he caught the fish, the boy could tell by the clarity of his father's voice that the decision was not negotiable. He slowly worked the hook out of the lip ofthe huge bass and lowered it into the black water.The creature swished its powerful body and disappeared. The boy suspected that he would never again see such a great fish.That was 34 years ago. Today, the boy is a successful architect in New York City. His father's cabin is still there on the island in the middle ofthe lake. He takes his own son and daughter fishing from the same dock.And he was right. He has never again caught such a magnificent fish as the one be landed that rught long ago. But he does see that same fish again and again-every time he comes up against a question ofethic.For, as his father taught him, ethic is simple matter of right and wrong. It is only the practice of ethic that is difficult. Do we do right when no one is looking? Do we refuse to cut corners to get the design in on time? Or refuse to trade stocks based on information that we know we aren't supposed to have?We would if we were taught to put the fish back when we were young, for we were still learning the truth. The decision to do right lives fresh and fragrant in our memory , It is a story we will proudly tell our friends and grandchildren. Not about how we had a chance to beat the system and took it, but about how we did the right thing and were forever strengthened.

他11 岁那时，只要―有机会，就会到新汉普郡湖中心岛上的自家小屋的码头上钓鱼。鲈鱼季节开放的前一天晚上，他和父亲早早开始垂钓，并用小虫作饵钓太阳鱼和鲈鱼。他系上鱼饵，练习如何抛线。鱼饵击在水面，在夕阳中漾起一片金色的涟漪，夜晚月亮升出湖面时，涟漪就变成了银色。当鱼杆向下弯的时候，他知道线的另一端一定钓到了一条大鱼。父亲看着他技巧娴熟地在码头边沿和鱼周旋，眼神中充满了赞赏。最后他小心翼翼地将筋疲力尽的鱼提出水面。这是他所见过的最大的一条，那是一条鲈鱼。男孩和他父亲看着这条漂亮的鱼，它的鱼鳃在月光下一张一翕。父亲点燃一根火柴，看了看表。 10点了――离开禁还有两个小时。他看了看鱼，又看了看男孩。“你得把它放回去，孩子，”他说道。“爸爸！”男孩叫道。“还有其他的鱼嘛，”父亲说道。“但没这么大，”男孩叫道。他环视着湖的四周，月光下附近没有其他的渔民或船只。他又看了看他父亲。从父亲不可动摇的语气中，他知道这个决定没有商量的余地，即使没有人看到他们，更无从得知他们何时钓到了鱼。他慢慢地将鱼钩从大鲈鱼的唇上取下，然后蹲下将鱼放回水中。鱼儿摆动着它强健的身躯，随即便消失在水中。男孩想，他可能再也看不到这么大的鱼了.那是34年前的事了。现在，男孩是纽约的一位成功的建筑师。他父亲的小屋依然在湖的中心岛上，他带着自己的儿女仍然在同一个码头上钓鱼。他猜得没错。自那次以后，他再也没有见过那么大的鱼了.但每次他面临道德难题而举棋不定的时候，他的眼前总是浮现出那条鱼。他父亲曾告诉他，道德即是简单的对和错的问题，但要付诸行动却很难。在没人瞧见的时候，我们是否仍始终如一，一丝不苟？为了将图纸及时送到，我们是不是也会抄近路？或者在明知道不可以的情况下，我们会不会仍将公司的股份卖掉？在我们还小的时候，如果有人要我们把鱼放回去，我们会这样做，因为我们还在学习真理。正确的决定在我们的记忆里变得深刻而清晰。这个故事我们可以骄傲地讲给朋友和子孙们听，不是关于如何攻击和战胜某种体制，而是如何作正确的决定，从而变得无比坚强。

My dream ended when I was born. Although I never knew it then, I just held on to something that would never come to pass. Dreams really do exist. But in the morning when you wake up, they are remembered just as a dream. That is what happened to me.I always had the dream to dance like a beautiful ballerina twirling around and around and hearing people applaud for me. When I was young,I would twirl around and around in the fields of wildflowers that grew in my backyard.I thought that if I twirled faster everything would disappear and I would wake up in a new place. Reality woke me up when I heard a voice saying, "I don't know why you bother trying to dance. Ballerinas are pretty , slender little girls. Besides, you don't have the talent to even be a ballerina." I remember how those words paralyzed every feeling in my body. I fell to the ground and wept for hours.We lived in the country by a nearby lake. I did not like to be at home.When my parents were home, my mother just yelled and criticized because nothing was ever perfect in her life. She dreamed of a different life but she ended up living in the country far away from the city where she believed her dreams would have come true.I enjoyed hanging out by the water. I would sit there for hours and stare at my reflection. There I was, looking nothing like a pretty ballerina dancer. Reflections don't lie. Once the waves would come, my reflection was gone. Washed away just like my dream to dance.As I grew older, I began to realize that the reason my dream was even born, was because it was something that was. inside of me. The dream I had was never nurtured and cared for, so it slowly died. It's not that I wanted it to die, but I allowed it to die the day I started listening to the words, "You can't do it." When I finally woke up from many years of dreaming, I realized that you can't settle for dancing in the wildflowers, you have to move on to the platform。

我一出生，梦想就结束了，然而当时我却毫不知晓，仍执著于一些永无实现之日的事情。我的确怀有许多梦想。不过，当早晨醒来之时，所记起的却只是一场梦境而已。我的经历就是如此。我一直梦想着像一个美丽的芭蕾演员一样跳舞，轻盈地旋来转去，耳边是人们的掌声喝彩。小时候，我常常在自家后院长满野花的草地上练习芭蕾舞的旋转动作。我想要是我转得再快一点，眼前的一切都会消失，我将会获得一方新的天地。然而现实唤醒了我，我听到一个声音说：“我不明白你为什么不厌其烦地尝试跳舞。跳芭蕾舞的人都长得漂亮、苗条、娇小可爱。还有，你也没有跳芭蕾舞的天分。”记得当时那些话让我的全身都失去了知觉。我瘫倒在地上，哭了好几个小时。我们家住在乡下，附近有一个湖。我不喜欢待在家里，妈妈总是在家里大喊大叫着抱怨生活处处不如意。 她曾经梦想着能够住在城市里，只有在那里她的理想才能实现，而后来却住在这远离城市的乡下，这与她的理想大相径庭。我喜欢到水边待着，在那儿，我常常一坐就是几个小时，静静地望着水中我的倒影。水中的我哪也不像一个漂亮的芭蕾舞演员，倒影从不撒谎。微波荡过，倒影消失了'就像我跳舞的梦想一样消失了。随着我的成长我开始明白之所以我的梦想会产生，是因为它就在我心里。而我从未培育和呵护过它，因此它慢慢地死去了。我并不想让它死去，但是从我听到“你办不到”这种话的那一天，我就放任了它的离去。最后，当我从多年来的梦想中醒来时，我才明白过来 你不能满足于在野花丛中跳舞，你必须设法到舞台上去跳。

Inside the Russian Embassy in London a KGB colonel pufTed a cigarette as he read the handwritten note for the third time. There was no need for the writer to express regret, he thought. Correcting this problem would be easy. He would do that in a moment. The thought of it caused a grim smile to appear and joy to his heart. But he pushed away those thoughts and tumed his attention to a framed photograph on his desk. His wife was beautiful, he told himself as he remembered the day they were
married. That was forty-three years ago, and it had been the proudest and happiest day ofhis life,What had happened to all that time? Why had it passed so quickly, and why hadn't he spent more ofit with her? Why hadn't he held her close and told her more often that he loved her?He cursed himself as a tear came from the comer ofhis eye, ran down his cheek, and then dropped onto the note. He stitTened and wiped his face with the back of his hand. There was no need for remorse or regret, he told himself. In a few moments he would join her and at that time would express his undying love and
devotion.After setting the note ablaze he dropped it into an ashtray and watched it burn. For a time the blaze cast moving shadows on the walls of the darkened room, then they nickered and died out. The colonel dropped the cigarette to the floor and ground it out with his heel, then clutched the photograph to his breast, removed a pistol from his pocket, placed the barrel in his mouth and pulled the trier. In the ashtray a small portion of the note remained. Where it had been wetted by his tear it had failed to bum, and on that scrap of paper were the words "died yesterday".

在伦敦的俄国使馆，一位克格勃上校一边抽着烟，一边读着一张手写的字条，这已是他第3次在读这张字条了口便条的作者不必表示遗憾了，上校这样想着。纠正这个错误其实很容易。他只要一会儿工夫便会做到。想到这里，他的脸上不禁浮现出一种可怕 的笑容，内心深处充满了快乐之情。上校从沉思中游离出来，将注意力集中到桌子上的一个像框上，他的妻子是位美丽的女人，当想起他们成婚的那一天时他不禁自语道。那已是43年前的事情了'可却是他一生中最自豪最幸福的日子。那些时候都发生了什么？为什么时光流逝得如此之快？为什么他没能将更多的时光用来陪伴她？为什么他没能将她搂紧，更多次地告诉她他爱她？ 他于是开始诅咒起自己，泪水也忍不住夺眶而出，流过面颊，最后滴落在字条上。这时，他板起了面孔，用手背揩去了眼泪。已经没有必要来自责与悔恨了他对自己说道。很快他不就会与她团聚了吗？到那时，他将再向她表达他永恒的爱与忠心。他点燃了字条，将它扔进了烟灰缸中，看着它慢慢地燃烧起来。在火苗的映衬下，这间漆黑的屋子里的四壁一时变得影影绰绰。不一会儿 ，火苗成了星星点点，渐渐地熄灭了。上校把香烟扔在了地板上，用后脚跟将其碾灭，随后抓起照片放在自己的胸前。他从衣兜中掏出一把手枪，将枪筒放进自己的嘴中，接着扣动了扳机。在烟灰缸中还残留着―小片字条，由于被上校的泪水浸湿而未能燃尽。在这块残片上有这样几个字“昨天去世”。

All over my garden I've planted nothing but roses, fragrant and if looked at from afar-ablaze with colour like sunset clouds. I would be very happy if any one of my visiting friends should desire to pick and take some for their homes.I trust that any friend of nune carrying the roses would vanish into the distance feeling that his emotion had been rekindled.A close friend came for a visit the other day, I know her to be a lover of flowers and plants, and for that reason I told her at her departure that she should pick a bunch of roses to decorate her boudoir. I promised that the scent ofthe roses would be wafted far, far away.That girl friend of mine, tiptoeing into the garden in high spirits, sniffed here and smelt there, but in the end she didn't pick a single rose. I said there were so many of them tbat she could pick as many as she'd like to, I told her that I was not a florist and didn't make a living out of them. While saying so I raised the scissors for the sacrifice of the flowers, but she vehemently stopped me, crying no, no, no!To cut such beautiful roses would hurt one, she said.With her hands clutching at my sleeves, she told me that by no means should they be cut. Roses are the smiling face of the earth, and who could be so iron hearted as to destroy a smile so exhilarating?My mind was thoroughly boggled: the ugly earth, the humble earth,the plain earth-it is only because of the roses that it reveals an amazing and bright smile, and it is for the sake of that smile that it wins the care and pity of men.Of late a friend of mine i_nvited me to appreciate a Tang Dynasty vase that he was fortunate enough to have bought at an auction. The vase, with its slim neck, plump body, and fine little flowers on a blue and white background, has a noble shape and a rich colouring, elegant, refined, proud, poised, and supercilious, an extreme embodiment of the prosperity of the Tang Dynasty. I was filled with wonder to think that while everyone present was talang great care not to cause the slightest damage to the Tang treasure, it was to me nothing but an object made of clay. It had only become a piece of classic art after being baked in a china kiln.Both the exqusiteness of the boccaro teapots made in south China, and the shockingly beautiful sculptures by Clay Sculptor Zhang of Tianjin aren't they all smiles of the earth? They are such exquisite treasures that-even if they look ugly, humble, plain, or whatever-they no doubt deserve respect and veneration.Now I understand that no one, however ordinary, should be condemned to anonymity, and that anyone who adds a dash of colour to life deserves our respect.

我在花园里种满了芬芳的玫瑰花，远远望去，他们像一片燃烧的晚霞。如果来访的朋友想摘些花带回家，我会很高兴。我相信朋友捧着火红的玫瑰渐渐走远的背影，一定能点燃易感的情怀。有一天，一位非常要好的女友来探望我，我知道她平素最喜欢花花草草了，临别时我说，采一束玫瑰点缀你的闺房，保证十里飘香。女友轻轻地跨进花园，东闻闻，西嗅嗅，神采飞扬，就是不肯采摘。我说没关系，多的是，并让她尽管采摘。我告诉她我又不是花店的老板，不会靠玫瑰赚钱的，说完我就举起剪刀准备献美。女友急忙拦住，高声叫着不可不可。这么美丽的玫瑰剪下来，让人心疼，她说道。她紧抓住我的袖子叮咛道：千万不能剪啊，玫瑰是泥土的微笑，谁忍心杀戮美得醉人的微笑？我的灵魂悚然一惊，丑陋的泥土、卑微的泥土、朴素的泥土，因为玫瑰，它露出了惊艳一笑。因为这一笑，它让人爱惜非常。近日，一个朋友在拍卖会上有幸购得一个花瓶，花瓶细颈大肚，碎花蓝白图案，看上去流光溢彩。从造型到色彩，整个如唐朝盛世的化身，雍容、华贵、高傲、悠闲，目空一切。朋友邀请我们大家观赏。奇怪的是每一个参观者都小心谨慎，生怕碰坏这盛唐的宝贝。其实它不过是一撮泥土而已，在经过窑烧之后才干修百炼成瓷中经典的口.江南的紫砂壶玲珑剔透，天津泥人张的彩塑令人拍案叫绝，它们不都是泥土的微笑吗？它们弥足珍贵，即使曾丑陋，即使曾卑微，即使曾朴素，同样让人肃然起敬。我懂得了，即使再平凡的人，也没有理由被埋没，只要努力活出色彩，一定会叫人刮目相看。

My brother-in-law opened the bottom drawer of my sister's bureau and lifted out a tissue wrapped package.“This," he said, “is not a piece of paper. This is lingerie." He discarded the tissue and handed me the lingerie. It was exqrusite; silk, handmade and trimmed with a cobweb of lace. The price tag with an astronomical figure on it was still attached. "Jan bought this the first time we went to New York at least 8 0r 9 years ago. She never wore it. She was saving it for a special occasion. Well, I guess this is the occasion." He took the lingerie from me and put it on the bed with the other clothes we were taking to the mortician。His hands lingered on the sofi material for a moment, then he slammed the drawer shut and tumed to me "Don't ever save anything for a special occasion. Every day you're alive is a special occasion." I remembered those words through the funeral and the days that followed when I helped him and my niece attend to all the sad chores that follow an unexpected death. I thought about them on the plane returning to Californiafrom the Midwestern town where my sister's family lives. I thought about all the things that she hadn't seen or heard or done. I thought about the things that she had done without realizing that they were special.I'm still thinking about his words, and they've changed my life. I'm reading more and dusting less. I'm sitting on the deck and admiring the view without fussing about the weeds in the garden. I'm spending more time with my family and friends and less time in comnuttee meetings. Whenever possible, life should be a pattem of experience to savor, not endure. I'm trying to recognize these moments now and cherish them.I'm not "saving" anything; we use our good cluna a-nd crystal for every special event-such as losing a pound, getting the sink unstopped, the first camellia blossom. I wear my good blazer to the market ifl feel like it. My theory is ifl look prosperous, I can shell out $28.49 for one small bag of groceries without wincing. I'm not saving my good perfu.me for special parties; clerks in hardware stores and tellers in banks have noses that function as well as my party-going friends'.“Someday" and "one of these days" are losing their grip on my vocabulary. Ifit's worth seeing or hearmg or doing, I want to see and hear and do it now. I'm not sure what my sister would have done, had she known that she wouldn't be here for the tomorrow we all take for granted. I think she would have called family members and a few close friends.She might have called a few formerfriendto apologize and mend fencesfor past squabbles. I like to think she would have gone out for a Chinese
dinner, her favorite food. I'm guessing I'll never I now。It's those liffle things left undone that would make me angry if I knew that my hours were limited. Angry because I put off seeing good friends whom I was going to get in touch with someday. Angry because I hadn't written certain letters that I intended to write one of these days.Angry and sorry that I didn't tell my husband and daughter often enough how much I truly love them.I'm trying very hard not to put off, hold back, or save anything that would add laughter and luster to our lives.And every moming when I open my eyes, I tell myself that it is special. Every day, every minute, every breath truly is ... a gift from God.

我的妹夫从我妹妹书桌最底下的抽屉里取出了_一个用纸片包裹的小包袱。“这可不是一张纸片，”他说，“这是件女式内衣。竹他打开包袱，把它拿过来递给我。这是件精致的丝质的手工缝制的女式内衣，还装饰着蛛网状的花边。衣服上甚至还钉着数额惊人的价格标签。“这件内衣是简和我第一次到纽约时买的，那至少是在八九年前了，但是她从没穿过它。她―直在等一个合适的机会，我想，现在该是时候了."他从我手中接过去，把它和其他一些我们要带到殡仪馆去的衣服一起摆到床上。他的手在那柔软的面料上停留了一会儿，然后关上抽屉转过身来对我说：“千万别为了什么东西去等什么合适的机会，你活着的每一天都是一个机会。” 在我帮着他和我的侄女处理因这场意外死亡而接踵而至的充满着悲伤琐事的葬礼期间，我一直在想着这句话。在从我妹妹居住的这个中西部地区的小镇飞往加利福尼亚的飞机上，我也在想着这句话。我想到那些她从没听过、见过或做过的事，我也想到那些她经历过但却没有意识到其独特性的事。到现在我还思考着他的话，它们甚至改变了我的一生。我开始读更多的东西，少受一点蒙蔽。我学会坐在地面上欣赏风景而不去担心花园里的杂草。我努力花更多的时间和家人待在一起而不是去开无聊的会议。不管何时，生活应该是享受而不是忍受。我已开始去认识并珍惜这些美妙的时刻。我不再珍藏任何东西。我会在各种小事情上使用上好的瓷器与水晶器，比如庆祝减掉一磅体重，打通厨房堵塞的排污槽，盛放初开的茶花。如果我喜欢，我会在逛市场时穿上我漂亮的冲锋衣。我的理论是，如果我看上去够有钱，我会毫不畏缩地花上28.49美元去买一小袋食品与杂货。我再也不会珍藏着我的名贵香水去期待一次特殊的晚会，商店职员和银行出纳员也有与我的舞友一样的鼻子。“总有一天”和“某一天”对我已失去了意义。如果某件事值得去看、去听、去做，我会立刻去实行。我不知道，如果我妹妹得知她将不会拥有我们都认为理所当然的明天时，她会去做什么。或许她会给家人和一些亲密的朋友打电话，或许她会为以前发生的口角给一些曾经的朋友打电话来道歉或弥补彼此的关系。我还想她出去吃她最爱的中餐。然而这都只是我的猜想，我永远不会知道她会做什么。当我知道自己时间紧张却有一些事情没有完成时，我会愤怒不已。为推迟拜访“总有一天”我会联络的朋友而恼火，为没有写下“某一天”我终究会写的信而生气，为没有足够多地告诉我的丈夫和女儿我是多么爱他们而感到后悔与遗憾。我尽了最大努力避免推迟、延误或保留那些能给我们的生活带来欢笑与光彩的事情。每天早晨睁开眼睛，我都告诉我自己这是特殊的一天。每一天、每一分钟、每一口呼吸……其实都是上帝给我们的恩赐。

Your letter of the lst hath this moment reached me. I answer it according to our agreement, which shall be inviolable. Truly did you say that, at our arising in the monung, nature assumes a different aspect.Who could have conjectured the circumstances of my last letter?Friend of my soul, this is temble, dismaying: it makes one's heart sink, it withers vital energy...Dear being, I am thine again; the happiness shall again predominate over this tleehng tribute to self-interest. Yet who would not feel now? Oh'twere as reckless a task to endeavor to annihilate perception while sense existed, as to blunt the sixth sense to such impressions as these! ...Forgive me, dearest friend? I pour out my whole soul to you. I write by fleeting intervals: my pen runs away with my senses. The impassionateness of my sensations grows upon me. Your letter, too, has much affected me,Never, with my consent, shall that intercourse cease which has been the day dawn of my existence, the sun which has shed warmth on the cold drear length of the anticipated prospect of life. Prejudice might demand the sacriftce, but she is an idol to whom we bow not.The world might demand it; its opinion might require; but the cloud which flees over yon mountain were as important to our happiness, to our usefulness. This must never be, never whilst this existence continues; and when time has enrolled us in the list of the departed, surely this friendship will survive to bear our identity to heaven.What is love, or friendship? Is it something material ... a ball, an apple, a plaything... which must be taken from one to be given to another? Is it capable of no extension, no communication? Lord Kaimes defines love to be a particularization of the general passion.But this is the love of sensation, of sentiment... the absurdest of absurd vanities: it is the love of pleasure,'not the love of happiness. The one is a love which is self-centered, self-interested: It desires its own interest, it is the parent ofjealousy. Its object is the plaything which it desires to monopolize.Selfishness, monopoly, is its very soul, and to communicate to others part ofthis love were to desrroy its essence, to annihilate this chain ofstraw.But love, the love which we worship, ...virtue, heaven, disinterestedness... in a word, friendship... which has as much to do with the senses as with yonder mountains, that which seeks the good of all... the good ofits object first, not because that object is a minister to its pleasures, not merely because it even contributes to its happiness, but because it is really worthy, because it has powers, sensibilities, is capable of abstracting itself, and loving virtue's own loveliness...Desiring the happiness of others not from the obligation of fearing hell or desiring heaven: but for pure, simple, unsophistlicated virtue. You will soon hear again. Adieu, my dearest friend. Continue to believe that when I am insensible to your excellence, I shall cease to exist.

"Can I see my baby?" the happy new mother asked.When the bundle was nestled in her arms and she moved the fold of cloth to look upon his tiny face, she gasped. The doctor turn quickly and looked out the tall hospital window. The baby had been born without ears.Time proved that the baby's hearing was perfect. It was only his appearance that was marred, When he rushed home from school one day and flung himselfinto his mother's arms, she sighed, knowing that his life was to be a succession of heart breaks.He blurted out the u'agedy: "A boy, a big boy...called me a freak."He grew up, handsome for his misfortune, A favorite with his fellow students, he might have been class president, but for that. He developed a gift, a talent for literature and music."But you might mingle with other young people," his mother reproved him, but felt a kindness in her heart. The boy's father had a session with the family physician...”Could nothing be done?""I believe I could graft on a pair of outer ears, if they could be procured," the doctor decided. Whereupon the search began for a person who would make such a sacrifice for a young man. Two years went by.One day, his father said to the son, "You're going to the hospital, son. Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need. But it's a secret." The operation was a brilliant success, and a new person emerged. His talents blossomed into genius, and school and college became a series of triumphs. Later he married and entered the diplomatic service. One day, he asked his father, "Who gave me the ears? Who gave me so much? I could never do enough for him or her." "I do not believe you could," said the father, "but the agreement was that you are not to know...not yet." The years kept their profound secret, but the day did come. One of the darkest days that ever pass though a son. He stood with his father over his mother's casket. Slowly, tenderly, the father stretched forth a hand and raised the thick, reddish brown hair to reveal the mother had no outer ears"Mother said she was glad she never let her hair be cut," his father whispered gently, "and nobody ever thought mother less beautiful, did they?"

I heard this storyr when I was in Vietnam, and it was told to me as fact. I have no way of knowing for sure that it is true, but I do know that stranger things have happened in war.Whatever their planned target, the mortar rounds landed in an orphanage run by a missionaryr group in the small Vietnamese village.The missionaries and two children were killed outright, and several more children were wounded,including one young girl, about eight years old.People from the village requested medical help from a neighboring town that had radio contact with the American forces. Finally, an American Navy doctor and nurse arrived in ajeep with onty their medical kits. They established that the girl was the most critically injured. Without quick action, she would die of shock and loss of blood.A transfusion was imperatlive, and a donor with a matching blood type was required. A quick test showed that neither American had the correct type, but several of the uninjured orphans did.The doctor spoke some pidgin Vietnamese, and the nurse a smattering of high school French. Using that combination, together with much impromptu sign language, they tried to explain to their young, frightened audience that unless they could replace some of the girl's lost blood, she would certainly die. Then they asked if anyone would be willing to give blood to help.Their request was met with wide eyed silence. After several long moments, a small hand slowly and waveringly went up, dropped back down, and then went up again."Oh, thank you," the nurse said in French. "What is your name?""Heng," came the reply.Heng was quickly laid on a pallet, his arm swabbed with alcohol,and a needle inserted in his vein. Through this ordeal Heng lay stiff and silent.After a moment, he let out a shuddering sob, quickly covering his face with his free hand."Is it hurting, Heng?" the doctor asked. Heng shook his head, but after a few moments another sob escaped, and once more he tried to cover up his crying. Again the doctor asked him if the needle hurt, and again Heng shook his head.But now his occasional sobs gave way to a steady, silent crying, his eyes screwed tightly shut, his fist in his mouth to stiflehis sobs.The medical team was concerned.Something was obviously very erong. At this point, a Vietnamese nurse arrived to help. Seeing the little one's distress, she spoke to him rapidly inVietnamese, listened to his reply and answered him in a soothing voice.After a moment, the patient stopped crying and looked questioningly at the Vietnamese nurse. When she nodded, a look of great relief spread over his face.Glancing up, the nurse said quietly to the Americans, "He thought he was dying. He misunderstood you. He thought you had asked him to give all his blood so the little girl could live.""But why would he be willing to do that?" asked the Nav}r nurse.The Vietnamese nurse repeated the question to the boy, who answered simply,¨She's my friend."Greater love has no man than this-that he will lay down his life for a friend.

我是在越南时听到这个故事的，而且它是被当作真事告诉我的。虽然我无法确认它是否属实，但我却知道，在战争中比这更离奇的事情都发生过。一次美军的例行炮击，击中了坐落在一个越南小村庄里的一所孤儿院，这是由一个传教团体创办的.那儿的众多传教士和两个孤儿在炮击中立刻丧命，还有更多的孩子受伤，其中包括一个8岁的小女孩。村里的人们请求附近的一个小镇给予医疗救助，因为该镇同美军部队之间有无线电联系。最后，一名美国海军的军医同他的护士带着他们的药箱乘一辆吉普车到达了该村。他们确诊这个小女孩的伤势最严重，若不立刻采取措施，她就会死于休克和失血。必须立即为她输血，而且要求找到一个血型同她相匹配的献血者．经过快速的化验，这两个美国人的血型都与小女孩不匹配，幸好有好几名未受伤的孤儿的血型都符合要求。这位军医能讲几句混杂的越南语，护士也能讲几句半生不熟的法语. 二位将他们仅有的语言技能加到一起，再加上一些即兴的手势语，努力地向这些被吓坏了的孩子们解释――除非他们能够献出一些血，来补充这个小女孩失掉的血，否则她一定会死去。然后他们问孩子们，有谁愿意献血来救活这个孩子。他们得到的回答却是孩子们睁大的眼睛和沉默。过了好久好久，才有一只小手慢慢吞吞地，犹犹豫豫地举起来接着又放下去，接着再一次举起来。"哦．谢谢你，"护士用法语说，“你叫什么名字？”"恒，"孩子管道。恒被很快地放到一张简陋的小床上，护士用酒精擦洗了他的胳膊之后，便将一根针头插进了他的静脉。在这个严酷的考验中，恒―直僵硬地躺着，默不作声。过了一会儿，他发出了一声战栗的抽泣，并且很快地用他的另外一只手掩住了自己的脸。"痛吗，恒？"医生问道。恒摇了摇头。可是，没过多久，他又抽泣了一声。而且他又一次竭力地掩盖自己的哭泣。于是医生再一次问他针头是否扎痛了他。然而，恒却再一次摇了摇头。可是，这时他的断断续续的抽泣已经无法克制，变成了一种持续的、无声的哭泣。他紧闭着双眼，把小拳头塞进嘴里，以控制自己的抽泣。医生和护士感到十分不安，显然有什么地方出了错。这时，终于有一位越南的护士来解围了。当她看见孩子的痛苦状态时，她很急切地用越南语对他说了几句话，在听了孩子的回答之后，她又用抚慰的声音解答了孩子的困惑。过了一会儿，小男孩停止了哭泣，然后疑惑地看着这位越南护士。当护士点头时，一种很明显的释然的表情才在孩子的脸上慢慢地展开.越南护士抬起头来，看着两个美国人，轻声地告诉他们：“他刚才以为自己要死了。他误解了你们的意思。他以为你们要他把自己所有的血都抽出来才能救活那个小女孩呢。"“可是为什么他还愿意献血呢？”海军护士问道。越南护士又向这个男孩重复了这个问题。男孩简单地答道：“因为她是我朋友。”没有一个人有这么伟大的爱―肯为一个朋友献出自己的生命。

The True Story Behind a Well-known Piece of ArtBack in the fifteenth century , in a tiny village near Nuremberg, lived a family with eighteen children. In order merely to keep food on the table, the father and head of the household, a goldsmith by profession, worked almost eighteen hours a day at his trade and any other paying chore he could find in the neighborhood Despite their seemingly hopeless condition, two of the children had a dream. They both wanted to pursue their talent for art, but they knew full well that their father would never be financially able to send either ofthem to Nuremberg to study at the Academy.After many long discussions at rught in their crowded bed, the two boys finally worked out a pact They would toss a coin. The loser would go down into the nearby mines and, with his eamings, support his brother while he attended the academy. Then, when that brother who won the toss completed his studies, in four years, he would support the other brother at the academy, either with sales of his artwork or, if necessary: also by laboring the mrnes.They tossed a coin on a Sunday morning after church. Albrecht Durer won the toss and went off to Nuremberg. Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the next four years, financedhis brother, whose work at the academy was almost an immediate sensation. Albrecht's etchings, his woodcuts, and his oils were far better than those of most of his professors, and by the time he graduated, he was beginning to earn considerable fees for his commissioned works. When the young artist retrurnedto his village, the Durer family held a festive dinner on their lawn to celebrate Albrecht's triumphant homecoming.After a long and memorable meal, punctuated with music and laughter, Albrecht rose from his honored position at the head ofthe table to drink a toast to his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled Albrecht to fulfill his ambition. His closing words were, "And now, Albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your tum. Now you can go to Nuremberg to pursue your dream, and I will take_care of you." All heads tumed in eager expectation to the far end of the table where Albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face, shaking his lowered head from side to side while he sobbed and repeated, over and over, "No ...no ...no ...no." Finally, Albert rose and wiped the tears from his cheeks. He glanced down the long table at the faces he loved, and then, holding his hands close to his right cheek, he said softly, "No, brother. I cannot go to Nuremberg. It is too late for me. Look... look what four years in the mines has done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been smashed at least once, and lately I have been suffering from arthrihs so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to retum your toast, much less make delicate lines on parchment or canvas with a pen or a brush。No, brother ... for me it is too Iate."More than 450 years have passed. By now, Albrecht Durer's hundreds of masterful portraits, pen and silver-point sketches, watercolors, charcoals, woodcuts, and copper engravings hang in every great museum, but the odds are great that you, like most people, are familiar with only one ofAlbrecht Durer's works. More than merely being familiar with it, you very well may have a reproduction hanging in your home or office.One day, to pay homage to Albert for all that he had sacrificed,Albrecht Durer painstakingly drew his brother's abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He called his powerful drawing simply "Hands", but the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed his tribute of love "The Praying Hands."

一幅名画背后的真实故事15世纪时，在德国的一个小村庄里，住着一个有18个孩子的家庭。父亲是一名冶金匠，为了维持一家生计，作为家中顶梁柱的他每天要工作18个小时，他所做的除了与冶金相关的活儿之外，还有在邻居那里寻找的一些差事。生活尽管窘迫逼人，然而这个家庭中的两个孩子却怀揣一个同样的梦想。他们两人都希望可以发展自己在艺术方面的天分。不过他们也了解，父亲无法在经济上供他们俩中的任何一个到纽伦堡艺术学院读书。晚上，两兄弟在床上经过多次讨论后，得出结论：以掷铜板决定胜者到艺术学院读书，败者则到附近的矿场工作赚钱，4年后，在矿场工作的那一个再到艺术学院读书，由学成毕业那一个赚钱支持，他可能会靠卖作品，如果需要，可能也要到矿场工作。星期日早上做完礼拜后，他们掷了铜板，结果，弟弟Albrecht Durer胜出，去了纽伦堡艺术学院。哥哥Albert则去了危险的矿场工作，4年来直为弟弟提供经济支持。Albrecht在艺术学院表现很突出，他的铜版画、木刻画和油画画得简直比教授的还要好。到毕业时，他的作品已经能赚不少钱。在这位年轻的艺术家返回家乡的那一天，家人在草坪上为他准备了盛宴，庆祝他学成归来。当漫长而难忘的宴席快要结束时，伴随着音乐和笑声，Albercht起身答谢敬爱的哥哥几年来对他的支持，并使他的梦想得以实现。他说：“现在轮到你了，亲爱的哥哥，我会全力支持你到纽伦堡艺术学院攻读，实现你的梦想！”所有的目光都急切地转移到桌子的另一端，坐在那里的脸色苍白的Albert双泪直流，只见他垂下头，边摇头边重复说着：“不……不……”终于，Albert站了起来，他擦干脸颊上的泪水，看了看长桌两边他所爱的亲友们的脸，把双手移近右脸颊，轻声地说：“不，弟弟，我上不了纽伦堡艺术学院了.太迟了.看看我的双手-4年的矿场工作，毁了我的手，最近我的右手又患有严重的关节炎，现在连举杯为你庆贺也不可能，何况是用钢笔或是笔刷在羊皮纸或帆布上画一些纤细、优美的线条呢？不，弟弟……已经太迟了．… ”450多年过去了’Albrecht Durer有成千上百部的杰作被流传下来，他的素描、水彩画、木炭画、木刻、铜刻等可以在世界各地的博物馆中找到，然而，大多数人最为熟悉的，却是其中的一件作品。也许，你的家里或者办公室里就悬挂着一件它的复制品呢。为了补偿哥哥所做的牺牲，表达对哥哥的敬意，一天，AlbrechtDurer了很大的工夫把哥哥合起向上的粗糙的双手给画了下来。他把这幅伟大的作品简单地称为“双手”，然而，全世界的人都立刻敞开心扉，瞻仰这幅杰作，并把这幅爱的作品重新命名为“祈祷之手 ”。

Love is EverythingThe winter cold hung in the air like a frozen dinosaur trying to thaw from lus glacier and walk across the earth. Breath iced like a tiny moming mist upon a meandering river. The sounds of the city rising and spilling into silence as the night began to claim its citizens for sleep. Blowing on gloved hands seemed to have little effect on cold hands that ached with chill. She had spent long hours hanging pressed clothes, pulling tickets and ringing up the customers. The last of the packaged hot chocolate was gone, leaving only the longing need for home and a hot pie to warm her.It was payday and she cashed her check. Two Santas and one Salvation Army captain later, she was minus ten dollars, but what did it matter? She had a place to sleep, something decent to eat, and she had Drew. Drew, with his kindness, his caring and his humor to lighten her day. Thanksgiving was nigh and they were collecting early for the hungry and the children that would have no Christmas without them.She was so much more lucky than most.of them but perhaps not as lucky as those that scurried in the Wednesday night sleet, shoppintg early before the piclangs became slim. Life was not always easy but sometimes it could be safe.She had Drew, and Smat, the ugly little terrier that nobody wanted.She had comfort and warmth in the apartment. She had dinner thawing for tomorrow, the small turkey; and the little Thanksgiving bonus from her boss. But most of all, she had love. It was the most important of all.

I was sure that I was to be killed. I became terribly nervous, I fumbled in my pockets to see if there were any cigarettes, which had escaped their search. I found one and because of my shaking hands, I could barely get it to my lips. But I had no matches, they had taken those. I looked through the bars at my jailer. He did not make eye contact with me. I called out to him:"Have you got a light?" He looked at me, shrugged and came over to light my cigarette. As he came close and lit the match,his eyes inadvertently locked with mine. At that moment, I smiled. I don't know why I did that. Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another,it is very hard not to smile. In any case, I smiled. In that instant, it was as though a spark jumped across the gap between our two hearts, our two human souls. I know he didn't want to, but my smile leaped through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile.I kept smiling at him, now aware of him as a person and not just a jailer. And his looking at me seemed to have a new dimension too. "Do you have kids?" he asked. "Yes, here, here." I took out my wallet and nervously fumbled for the pictures of my family. He, too, took out the pictures ofhis family and began to talk about his plans and hopes for them. My eyes filled with tears. I said that I feared that I'd never see my familyagain, never have the chance to see them grow up. Tears came to his eyes, too. Suddenly, without another word, he unlocked my cell and silently led me out. Out of the jail, quietly and by back routes, out of the town. There,at the edge of town, he released me. And without another word, he tumed back toward the town."My life was saved by a smile." Yes, the smile-the unaffected, unplanned, natural connection between people... I really believe that if that part of you and that part of me could recognize each other, we wouldn't be enenues. We couldn't have hate or envy or fear.

One fine aftemoon I was walking along Fifth Avenue, when I remembered that it was necessary to buy a pair of socks. I turned into the first sock shop that caught my eye, and a boy clerk who could not have been more than seventeen years old came forward. “What can I do for you, sir?" "I wish to buy a pair of socks." His eyes glowed. There was a note of passion in his voice. "Did you know that you had come into the finest place in the world to buy socks?" I had not been aware ofthat, as my entrance had been accidental. "Come with me," said the boy, ecstatically. I followed him to the rear ofthe shop, and he began to haul down from the shelves box after box, displaying their contents for my delectation."Hold on, lad, I am going to buy only one pair!" "I know that," said he, "but I want you to see how marvelously beautiful these are. Aren't they wonderful?" There was on his face an expression of solemn and holy rapture, as if he were revealing to me the mysteries of his religion.I became far more interested in him than in the socks. I looked at him in amazement."My friend," said I, "if you can keep this up, if this is not merely the enthusiasm that comes from novelty, from having a new job,
if you can keep up this zeal and excitement day after day, in ten years you will own every sock in the United States."My amazement at his pride and joy in salesmanship will be easily understood by all who read this article. In many shops the customer has to wait for someone to wait upon lum, And when finally some clerk does deign to notice you, you are made to feel as if you were interrupting him.Either he is absorbed in profound thought in which he hates to be disturbed or he is skylarking with a girl clerk and you feellike apologizing for thrusting yourselfinto such intimacy. He displays no interest either in you or in the goods he is paid to sell. Yet possibly tbat very clerk who is now so apathetic began his career with hope and enthusiarsm. The daily grind was too much for him; the novelty wore off; his only pleasures were found outside of working hours, He became a mechanical, not inspired, salesman. After being mechanical, he became incompetent; then he saw younger clerks who had more zest in their work, promoted over him. He became sour. That was the last stage. His usefulness was over.I have observed this melancholy decline in the lives of so many men in so many occupations that I have come to the conclusion that thesurest road to failure is to do things mechanically. There are many teachers in schools and colleges who seem duller than the dullest of their pupils; they go through the motions of teaching, but they are as impersonal as a telephone.

一个晴朗的下午，我沿第5大街而行，忽然想起需要买双袜子。我便拐进所看到的第一家袜店，一个不到17岁的少年售货员迎上来：“先生，我能为您效劳吗？”“我想买双短袜。”他双眸是热情，声音饱含激情：“您知道您来到了世界上最好的袜店吗？_我倒并未意识到这点，我不过是随便进来的。“ 随我来，”男孩欣喜若狂地说。我跟着他往里走。他开始从货架上拽下一个又．个盒子，向我展示里面的袜子，让我欣赏。“停一停，孩子，我只买―双！”“我知道，”他说，“但我想让您瞧瞧这些袜子是多么漂亮、多么令人赞叹！难道它们不棒吗？”他的脸色庄严而虔诚，就像是在向我透露他信仰中的奥秘似的。我对他远远超过了对袜子的兴趣。我吃惊地打量着他。 “我的朋友，丹我说，“如果你能这样保持下去，如果这热情并不仅仅缘于新奇，缘于找到份新工作，如果你能日复一日地保持这种热心和激情，不出10年，全美国的每_双袜子都将是从你手中卖出去的？我对他推销时的自豪与欣喜所感到的诧异，读者们应当不难理解。在很多店铺，顾客不得不等待有人来招呼他们。当终于有个售货员肯屈尊理你，那样子又让你感觉像是打扰了他。他不是陷于讨厌被人搅扰的深思之中，就是和女售货员嬉戏调笑；而你不适时的插入打断了他们的亲呢，为此你感觉好像需要道歉似的。他显示出对你和他拿着工资去卖的东西毫无兴趣。然而，就是这样一个如此冷漠的售货员，或许当初也是满怀希望和热情开始工作的。天天枯燥乏味的苦差事令他不堪忍受，新鲜感磨去了'唯一的乐趣只能在工作之外找到。他成了一个机 械的、没有干劲的售货员。机械呆板之后便是笨拙无能。随后，看到比他年轻、工作热情比他高的售货员得到了提拔，在他之上，他于是变得烦躁刻薄。此时便到了他职业生涯的最后阶段。他不再有用了。我观察到，很多职业中的许多人在人生道路上都有这种可悲的堕落。由此我得出结论：机械地应付差事是离失败最近的路。大中小学里的许多教师，似乎比他们最最迟钝的学生还要呆滞，他们似乎也搐搞教学，却毫无人的感情，就如同一部电话机。

Years of stonns had taken their toll on the old windmill. Its wheel,rusted and fallen, lay silent in the lush bluegrass. Its once animated silhouette was now a tall motionless steeple in the twilight sun.I hadn't walked across our old farm in fifteen years, Yet the sensations came flooding back. I could smell the fieshness of new mown alfalfa. I could feel the ping of the ice cold summer rain, and the sun's sudden warmth on my wet shoulders when it reappeared after a brisk July thunderstorm.Rain or shine, I used to walk this path each day to see Greta. She always made me smile, even after sister and I had just had a big squabble. I would help Greta with her chores. Then we would visit over a generous helping ofher delicious homemade chocolate cookies and ice cream. Being confined to a wheel chair didn't stop Greta from being a fabulous cook.Greta gave me two of the greatest gifts I've ever received. First, she taught me how to read. She also taught me that when I forgave sister for our squabbles, it meant I wouldn't keep feeling like a victim. Instead, I would feel sunny.Mr. Dinking, the local banker, tried to foreclose on Greta's house and land after her husband passed away. Thanks to Pa and Uncle Johan, Greta got to keep everything. Pa said that it was the least he could do for someone talented enough to teach me to read!Soon folks were coming from miles around to buy Greta's homemade cakes, pies, breads, cookies, cider, and ice cream. Hank, the grocery store man, came each week to stock his shelves and bring Greta supplies.Greta even had me take a big apple pie to Mr. Dinking who became one of her best customers and friends. That's just how Greta was. She could tum anyone into a friend!Greta always said ,"Dear,keep walking in sunshine ！"No matter "how terrible my day started, I always felt sunny walking home from Greta's house-even beneath the winter starlight.I arrived at Greta's house today just after sunset. An ambulance had stopped a few feet from her door, it's red lights flashing When I ran into the old house, Greta recognized me right away.She smiled at me with her unforgettable twinkling blue eyes. She was almost out ofbreath when she reached out and softly touched my arm. Her last words to me were "Dear, keep walking in sunsh.ine!I'm sure that Greta is walking in the brightest sunshine she's ever seen. And, I'm sure that she heard every word I read at her memorial service.I chose a beautiful verse by Leo Buscaglia. It's one that Greta taught me to read many years ago...Love can never grow old. Locks may lose their brown and gold. Cheeks may fade and hollow grow. But the hearts that love will know, never winter's frost and chill, summer's warmth is in them still."

She wished she had her favorite Jumper on it kept her really warm. She imagined having it with her, This thought dissipated when she finally saw her front door. It seemed different.

"My daughter!" Other well-meaning parents tried to pull him off what was left of the school, saying: "It's too late! They're all dead! You can't help! Go home! Come on, face reality, there's nothing you can do!"To each parent he responded with one line: "Are you going to help me now?'And then he continued to dig for his son, stone by stone.The fire chief showed up and tried to pull him off the school's ruins saying,¨Fires are breaking out, explosions are happening every where. You're in danger. We'll take care ofit. Go home." To which this loving, caring American father asked, "Are you going to help me now?"The police came and said, "You're angry, anxious and it's over. You're endangering others. Go home. We'll handle it!" To which he replied, "Are you going to help me now?" No one helped.Courageously he went on alone because he needed to know for himself. "Is my boy alive or is he dead?"He dug for eight hours...12 hours...24 hours...36 hours...then, in the 38th hour, he pulled back a large stone and heard his son's voice. He screamed his son's name, "Armand!" He heard back, "Dad? It's me, Dad! I told the other kids not to worry* I told them that if you were alive, you'd save me and when you saved me, they'd be saved.

Yellowstone National Park This natural wonders unparalleled beauty inspired the U.S. government to create the world's first national park. For a young country just coming of age in the early 1800s, the discovery of Yellowstone helped define America's identity with its vast, bold landscape.Today, Yellowstone's identity is closely associated with its powerful, natural geysers such as the ever present: Old Faithful. Old Faithful erupts about every 85-87 nunutes. It is 130-140 feet tall and is magnificent.The incredible geysers and picture postcard landscape brought Yeowstone its fame. But today, its wildlife population is just as popular.The most contlroversial of these is Yellowstone's wolf population. Until receritly, the wolf was almost extinct.This world has been obsessed with killing wolves. We have been killing wolves for cenUturies,probably for thousands ofyears. Afraid of the threat wolves would pose to their livestock, governmentbounty hunters in the early 1900s, killed Yellowstone s grey wolves for the price of fifteen dollars a head. They were hunted to near extinction. It would be almost a century before an effort would begin to reverse this damage,In 1995, Yellowstone's wolfpopulation was almost gone, so Douglas Smith (Yellowstone's Wolf Preservation Project Leader) went to Canada to capture fourteen of the animals in an effort to revive Yellowstone's wolf population. Douglas said:¨Catching a wolf is a tough thing to do. And there's nothing more exciting than flying over a wolfin a helicopter. You throw a net over them, they get tangled up, and then you go up and sedate them. When you move a wolf from one location to another, they try and get back home. We held them for about ten weeks inside the pens.'One of the transplanted wolves in particular, has had a lot to do with the parks wolf repopulation. This wolf, a female known as No.9, is one ofthe park's top breeders, and 70/o of the wolves born in the park today have her genes. Wolves are now the marquee animal in Yellowstone. Many people said it was a lifetime experience seeing a wolfin the wild in Yellowstone.

这自然奇观以其无与伦比的美景促使美国政府辟建了世界上第一个国家公园。作为一个19世纪初叶才发展起来的年轻国家，黄石地区的开辟使美国以其辽阔而雄浑的自然风光著称于世。今天，黄石国家公园的特色是与其许多天然间歇泉紧密地联系在一起的，诸如迄今尚存的“老忠实喷泉”。“老忠实喷泉”每隔85到87分钟喷射一次，高达130到140英尺，十分壮观。奇特的喷泉与印在明信片上的美丽景色使黄石国家公园闻名遐迩。但今天，这里的野生动物数量同样引人关注，其中最有争议的是黄石国家公园狼的数目。最近，它们已濒临灭绝。狼群_直在遭受捕杀，人们杀狼已有数百年，或者几千年的历史。担心狼群会危及家畜，政府在20世纪初开始奖赏猎手，杀死黄石公园一头灰狼赏15美元，后来，它们几乎被捕杀殆尽。直到近一个世纪以后，人们才开始弥补这个损失。1995年，黄石公园已经几乎没有狼。于是，道格拉斯・史密斯（黄石国家公园狼群保护计划负责人）从加拿大捕来14只狼，希望能够恢复黄石国家公园狼的数量。道格拉斯说：“捕狼并非易事。再也没有比坐在直升机上捕狼更令人兴奋的事了。你扔下一张网罩住它们，它们就被裹住了'然后你走上前去，给它们注射镇静剂。当你把狼从一个地方移居到另一个地方时，它们总是试图回到原来的家。我们要把它们在围栏里关上10周左右。”在这些被移居的狼当中，有一只与公园内狼群数量的重建关系特别密切。这是一只被称为“9号”的母狼，它是公园里繁殖能力最强的狼之_，今天，在公园里出生的狼70%都有它的基因。狼现在已经成了黄石国家公园的招牌动物。许多人都说在黄石国家公园看见野生的狼是一种终生难忘的体验。

Perhaps you have a big test coming up and you are feeling nervous. These days,it is pass or perish,so you know you have got to do well. The pressure is on, so you may be losing sleep and the ability to concentrrtte. How can you deal with the stress, study effectively, and take the test with confidence? Maybe you should try medltation.When people think about meditation, many picture old men sitting cross-legged on remote mountaintops. People describing meditation frequently mention elements such as gurus, relaxation, and "tlunking about nothing".It is not necessary to travel to a mountaintop to enjoy the benefits of meditation because it is actually more about awareness than just relaxation.The secret to meditation is breatlung.To start meditating, find a place where you can sit or stand comfortably for a little while and concentrate. Close your eyes and start taking slow breaths. Focus on the air moving in and out ofyour body, If your mind starts to wander and you begin to think about something else, refocus your attention on your breathing.Meditation has little to do with escaping problem or thinking about notlung..lnstead, the breathing techniques help you calm down and think more clearly about your feelings. The issues on your mind unfold clearly, as ifthey were in slow motion.This clarity is called "mindfulness". Being mindful means that you are aware of what you are thinking without becoming caught up in your thoughts. It takes practice, but with time, that big test will not scare you any more. You will realize through meditation that fear is just a product of not being mindful.

But forgiveness is possible, and it can be surprisingly beneficial to your physical and mental health."People who forgive show less depression, anger and stress and more hopefulness," pays Fredenc, Ph. D., author of ForgNe for Good, "So it can help save on the wear and tear on our organs, reduce the wea:dng out of the immune system and allow people to feel more vital."So how do you start the healing? Try the following steps:Calm yourself to defuse your anger, try a simple stress-management technique. "Take a couple of breaths and think of something that gives you pleasure: a beautiful scene in nature, or someone you love," Frederic says.Don't wait for an apology, "Many times the person who hurt you has no intention of apologizing," Frederic says, "they may have wanted to hurt you or they just don't see things the same way. So if you wait for people to apologize, you could be waiting anawfully long time." Keep in mind that forgiveness does not necessarily mean reconciliatIon with the person who upset you or condoning of his or her action。Take the control away from your offender.Mentally replayu:Syour hurt gives power to the person who caused you pain.¨Instead of focusing on your wounded feelings, learn to look for the love, beauty and kindness around you," Frederic says.Try to see things from the other person's perspective. If you empathize with that person, you may realize that he or she was acting out of ignorance, fear, even love. To gain perspectrive, you may want to write a letter to yourself from your offender's point of view.Recognize the benefits of forgiveness. Research has shown that people who forgive report more enery , better appetite and better sleep pattems.Don't forget to forgive yourself. "For some people, forgiving themselves is the biggest challenge," Frederic says, "but it can rob you of your self-confidencee ifyou don't do it."

The sun has feet, look, he is treading on, lightly and furtfvely; and I am caught, blankly, in his revolution,Thus the day flows away through the sink when I wash my hands, wears offin the bowl when I eat my meal.,and passes away before my day-dreammg gaze as refiect in silence. I can feel his haste now, so I reach out my hands to hold him back, but he keeps flowing past my withholding hands. In the evening, as I lie in bed, he strides over my body, glides past my feet, in his agile way. The moment I open my eyes and meet the sun again, one whole day has gone. I bury my face in my hands and heave a sigh. But the new day begins to flash past in the sigh.What can I do, in this bustling world, with my days flying in their escape? Nothing but to hesitate, to rush. What have I been doing in that eight-thousand-day rush, apart from hesitating? Those bygone days have been dispersed as smoke by a light wind, or evaporated as mist by the moming sun. What traces have I left behind me? Have I ever left?behind any gossamer traces at all? I have come to the world, stark naked; am I to go back, in a blink, in the same stark nakedness? It is not fair though: why should I have made such a trip for nothing!You the wise, tell me, why should our days leave us, never to return?

燕子去了'有再来的时候；杨柳枯了，有再青的时候；桃花谢了，有再开的时候。但是，聪明的，你告诉我，我们的日子为什么一去不复返呢？――是有人偷了他们罢：那是谁？又藏在何处？是他们自己逃走了．现在又到了哪里呢？我不知道他们给了我多少日子，但我的手确实是渐渐空虚了。在默默地算着，8000多个日子已经从我手中溜去，像针尖上的一滴水滴在大海里，我的日子则滴在时间的流水里，没有声音也没有影子。我不禁头涔涔而泪潸潸了.去的尽管去了，来的尽管来着，去来的中间，又是怎样的匆匆呢？早上我起来的时候，小屋里射进两三方斜斜的太阳。太阳他有脚啊，轻轻悄悄地挪移了，我也茫茫然跟着旋转. 于是――洗手的时候，日子从水盆里过去，吃饭的时候，日子从饭碗里过去．默默时，便从凝然的双眼前过去。我觉察他去的匆匆了’伸出手遮挽时，他又从遮挽着的手边过去，天黑时，我躺在床上，他便伶伶俐俐地从我身边垮过，从我脚边飞去，等我睁开眼和太阳再见，这算又溜走了-一日.我掩着面叹息。但是新来的日子的影儿又开始在叹息里闪过了.在逃去如飞的日子里，在千门万户的世界里的我能做些什么呢？只有徘徊罢了’只有匆匆罢了，在8000多日的匆匆里，除徘徊外，又剩些什么呢？ 过去的日子如轻烟却被微风吹散了，如薄雾却被初阳蒸融了，我留着些什么痕迹呢？我何曾留着像游丝一样的痕迹昵？我赤裸裸地来到这世界，转眼间也将赤裸裸地回去罢？但不能平的，为什么偏要白白走这．遭啊？你聪明的告诉我，为什么我们的日子一去不复返呢？

"To be or not to be". Outside the Bible, these six words are the most famous in all the literature of the world. They were spoken by Hamlet when he was thinking aloud, and they are the most famous words in Shakespeare because Hamlet was speaking not only for himself but also for every thinking man and woman. To be or not to be, to live or not to live, to live richly and abundantly and eagerly, or to live dully and meanly and scarcely. A philosopher once wanted to know whether he was alive or not, which is a good question for everyone to put to himself occasionally. He answeredit by saying:¨Ithink, therefore Iam.”But the best definition of existence I ever saw was one written by another philosopher who said: "To be is to be in relations." If this is true, then the more relations a living thing has, the more it is alive. To live abundantly means simply to increase the range and intensity of our relations. Unfortunately we are so constituted that we get to love our routine. But apart from our regular occupation how much are we alive? If you are interested only in your regular occupation, you are alive only to that extent. So far as other things are concemed-poetry and prose, music, pictures, sports, unselfish friendships, politics, intemational affairs-you are dead. Contrariwise, it is true that every time you acquire a new interest-even more, a new accomplishment-you increase your power of life. No one who is deeply interested in a large variety of subjects can remain unhappy, the real pessimist is the person who has lost interest. Baam said that a man dies as often as he loses a friend. But we gain new life by contacts, new friends. What is supremely true ofliving objects is not less true of ideas, which are also alive. Where your thoughts are, there will your live be also. Ifyour thoughts are confined to your business, only to your physical welfare, only to the narrow circle of the town in which'you live, then you live in a narrow circumscribed life. But if you are interested what is going on in China, then you are living in China if you'te interested in the characters of a good novel, then you are living with those highly interesting people, if you listen intently to fine music, you are away from your immediate surroundings and living in a world of passion and imagination.To be or not to be to live intensely and richly, merely to exist, that depends on ourselves. Let us widen and intensify our relations. While we live, let us live !

“活着还是不活。”如果把《圣经》除外，这6个字便是整个世界文学中最有名的6个字了．这6个字是哈姆雷特一次喃喃自语时说的，而这6个字也就成了莎士比亚作品中最有名的几个字了，因为这里哈姆雷特不仅道出了他自己的心声，同时也代表了一切有思想的男男女女。活着还是不活――是要生活还是不要生活，是要生活得丰满充实、兴致勃勃，还是活得枯燥委琐、贫乏无味。 一位哲人一次曾想弄清他自己是否是在活着，这个问题我们每个人也大可不时地问问我们自己。这位哲学家对此的答案是：“我思故我在。”但是关于生存我所见过的一条最好的定义却是另一位哲学家下的：“生活即是联系。”如果这话不假的话，那么一个有生命者的联系越多，它也就越有生气。所谓要活得丰富充实也即是要扩大和加强我们的各种联系。不幸的是，我们往往会因为天性不够丰厚而容易陷入自己的陈规旧套。试问除去我们的日常工作，我们的真正生活又有多少？如果你只是对你的日常工作才有兴趣，那你的生活也就很有限了。至于在其他事物方面―一比如诗歌、散文、音乐、美术、体育、无私的友谊、政治与国际事务，等等――你只是死人一个。 但反过来说，每当你获得一种新的兴趣_―．甚至一项新的造诣――你就增长了你的生活动力。一个能对许许多多事物都深感兴趣的人是不可能总不愉快的，真正的悲观者只能是那些丧失兴趣的人。墙根曾讲过，一个人失去朋友即是死亡。但是凭着交往、凭着新朋，我们就能获得再生。这条对于活人可谓千真万确的道理，在一定程度上也完全适用于人的思想，它们也都是活的。你的思想之所在，也是你的生命之所在。如果你的思想走不出你的业务范围，走不出你的物质利益，走不出你所在城镇的狭隘圈子，那么你的一生便也只是多方受着局限的狭隘的一生。但是如果你对当前中国那里所发生的种种感兴趣，那么你便可说也活在中国，如果你对一本绝妙小说中的人物感兴趣，你便是活在一批极有趣的人们中间；如果你能全神贯注地听点好的音乐，你就会超脱出你的周围环境而活在一个充满激情与想象的神奇世界之中。活着还是不活――活得热烈、活得丰富，还是只是简单存在，这就全在我们自己。但愿我们都能不断阔展和增强我们的各种联系。只要一天我们活著，就要一天是在活着。

Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind;It is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees;It is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions,It is the fresbness ofthe deep springs of life.Youth means a tempera-mental predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. This ofien exists in a man of 60 more than a boy of 20.Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and tums the spring back to dust. Whether 60 0r 16, there is in every human being's heart the lure of wonder, the unfailing childlike appetite of what's next and the joy of the game ofliving.In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station:so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from the Infinite, so long are you young.When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you are grown old, even at 20, but as long as your aerials are up, to catch waves of optimism, there is hope you may die young at 80.

Your Mind Is A GardenSome time ago, Sofan and I were visiting some friends in the country.We were staying in a beautiful little guest cabin, surrounded by fruit trees,flowers and even a few goats. Painted above the doorway in brightly colored, flowing letters were the words:Your mind is a garden.Your thoughts are the seeds.You can grow flowers or.You can grow weeds.Little did we know it at the time, but this little poem was to have a pound both on our thought patterns aswell as our artworks.It started almost as a kind of game. We decided to make a real effort to watch our thoughts and see exactly what it was that we were planting in our own "Mind Gardens". It was difficult first, but gradually, we began to pay more and more attention to what thoughts were repeatedly flashing across our minds.How disturbing it was to discover that many of these“seeds" were extremely negahve thoughts destined to grow patches of thorny thistles and stinging nettles in our daily lives!We gradually came to see how so many of the problems and difficulties we were encountering in our lives had their beguuungs in the seeds of doubt, fear and anxiety that we were continually planting in our It does take effort, but like anything else it gets easier with practice, and the amazing thing is, as we became more and more aware of these negative thoughts we are able to say:"No! I will not plant this weed in the Garden of my Mind."I will consciously choose to plant something better.The results are truly spectacular. When you start to consciously cultivate your own mind garden, you will truly be amazed at the changes which begin to happen in your life. Obstacles disappear, barriers fall away, and tlungs that you once thought were either impossible or very far away will suddenly come into view.Any garden is an ongoing process. It's not enough to just plant a single seed of happiness and then forget about it. Your frail little seedlmg would soon be choked by weeds. It is necessary to continuously pull out and throw away those weeds of fear, doubt and anxiety as soon as they appear.Love, happiness and tranquility are all contagious. People who are continuously planting these seeds in theirown minds are also planting them in other people.Remember:Your mind is a garden.Your thoughts are the seeds.You can grow flowers or, You can grow weeds.So ask yourself, what are you going to grow in the glorious garden of your mind? May your life be filled with love, happiness and inspiration.

心如花园不久前，我和索芬于乡间访友，暂居在一个给客人住的小木屋里。木屋很是漂亮，四周果树环绕，花开遍野．甚至还有几只山羊在屋旁踯躅。屋门上的几行漆字，颜色鲜亮，字体流畅。写的是：心如花园，思想为种。既得繁花，亦生野稗。当时我们不甚懂得这首小诗，但后来它却给我们的思维模式与艺术作品带来了深远的影响。刚开始的时候几乎就像一场游戏。我们决定下一番真功夫去观察自己的思想，把我们在自己:心园"里种下的东西看个真切。起初并不容易，但渐渐地，我们开始愈发关注在自己心中反复闪过的是何种思想。当发现大多数的"思想之种"都是很负面的思想，注定要在我们的日常生活中长成一丛丛带刺的野蓟、荨麻的时候，这是多么让人烦恼啊！我们渐渐发现，我们在生活中遇到的诸多问题与困难，其源一头正是我们不断在心中种下的疑惑、恐惧与焦虑的种子。这的确是件费劲的事，但跟其他所有事一样，它也是熟能生巧，令人惊异的是当我们越来越多地意识到这些负面的思想时，我们就能说：“不！我不会把这颗杂草种在我的心园。"我会有意识地去选择，种一些更好的东西，结果肯定会收获颇丰的。当你开始有意识地去耕作自己的心园时，生命中因此发生的改变会令你大为惊异。障碍消失了，隔阂不见了，你一度认不可能或离你很遥远的事情会突然展现在你眼前。每一个花园都处在不断地变化之中。仅种下一颗幸福的种子，接着又抛之脑后是不行的。你那孱弱的秧苗很快就会被野稗吞噬。那些恐惧、疑惑与焦虑的野稗一长出来，就要持之以恒地把它们拔除扔掉。爱、幸福与宁静都是有感染力的.那些在自己心园里不断播种这些种子的人们，他们也会把它们种到别人的心里去。请记住：心如花园，思想为种。既得繁花，亦生野稗。故而问问自己，你会在自己绚丽的心园里种些什么昵？愿你的生活充满爱、幸福与灵感。

The Road of LifeThe lives of most men are determined by their environment. They accept the circumstances amid which fate has thrown them not only with resignation but even with good will.They are like streetcars running contentedly on theirrails and they despise the sprightly flitter that dashes in and out of the traffic and speeds so jauntily across the open country. I respect them; they are good citizens, good husbands, and good fathers, and of course somebody has to pay the taxes;but I do not find them exciting. I am fascinated by the men, few enough in all conscience, who take life in their own hands and seem to mould it to their own liking. It maybe that we have no such thing as free will, but at all events, we have the illusion of it. At a cross-road it does seem to us that we might go either to the right or the left and, the choice once made, it is difficult to see that the whole course of the world's history obliged us to take the tuming we did.

Successful people always have adream. They dream big dreams and then display great courage to do things that others say cannot be done.Your dreams form the foundation of success. Many people have long forgotten the dreams they used to have when they were kids.As they grow older, they are simply too caught up with their work actiivities that they fail to discover what they really want to pursue in life. They find themselves trapped in a routine work system that can potentially rob them of their dreams.To get you back on track to pursue your dreams, follow these steps:Learndream again: We are bom to dream. Children often share their dreams and what want to be when they grow up.But we hear of teachers yelling in school: "Stop dreaming and pay attention in class!" Parents, too, have shrieked: "Stop dreaming and get on with your homework!" Leaming and growing up in such an environment, one may regard dreaming as an unproducdve act. As children grow up, they are told to forget their dreams and be prachcal because they are living in a"real" world In the end, many do get "realistic" and give up their dreams eventually.Dream big dreams: Never set mental ooundaries on what you are capable of achieving. Dreams are free anyway, so as long as you are dreanung, you might as well dream big. Many people cannot realize their dreams and achieve greater success because they limit theirrown beliefs.Flee from dream killers: Dream killers are devastating to your success. Your friends, colleagues, and even loved ones can be one of your dream killers. There are people who will try to dtstract, confuse, or persuade you to build the life they want, not the life that you want.Stop listening to the people who tell you why you will not achieve your dreams. You just need to believe you can do whatever it is you want to do.Other people can only discourage us temporarily, but you are the only one who can prevent yourself from being discouragedStop giving excuses: Kids talk frequently about what they can do, whereas many adults do the opposite. Adults tend to talk about what they cannot do and why.You should stop giving reasons why you cannot achieve your dreams, Many so-called reasons are merely excuses.If you continue giving excuses for not achieving, it will not take long before you convince yourself that you really cannot accomplish what you originally set out to achieve.As Henry Ford wisely put it: "Whether you think you can or cannot, you're absolutely right."Take action immediately: Once you have big and clear dreams, take immediate action to work towards making them come true. Very often ，if people do not translate their intenhon into action soon their passion will begin to diminish.Weeks later, the passion will grow cold and months later, that passion may be gone forever. Think about this: Five birds are resting on the fence and minutes later, three birds decide to fly off to search for food. How many birds are Ieft on the fence?TWO? Wrong! There should still be five birds on the fence because deciding to fly offis not the same as the actual act of flying off. The birds would not be able to food until they start to take action and fly out of their comfort zone.

成功人士通常都有一个梦。他们抱有很大的梦想，然后凭借巨大的勇气去完成那些其他人认为无法完成的事情。你的梦想构建了成功的基石，许多人早已忘记他们儿时的梦想，当他们长大成人后，又只是整天忙于工作而没能发现他们在生活中真正想追求的东西，他们发现自己陷于日常生活事物中，而这很有可能会掠走他们的梦想。要回到追求梦想的道路，请遵循以下步骤：学会再次做梦：我们天生就会做梦。 孩子经常与人分享他们的梦想以及他们对长大后想做些什么的憧憬。然而，我们经常听到学校老师的训斥：“别做梦了，注意听讲！”家长们也常常喝斥我们：“别做梦了，快点做功课！”在这样的环境中学习和成长，人们会把做梦当作一种徒劳无益的行为。随着孩子们的成长，他们被灌输的是忘记梦想，实际一些，因为他们生活在一个“现实的”世界里。结果是许多人确实变得“现实”了 ，最终放弃了他们的梦。敢于做伟大的梦: 永远不要给自己有能力做到的事情设定心理界限。既然梦想是免费的，既然你已在做梦，为什么不放飞你的梦想呢？许多人不能实现自己的梦想，不能取得更大的成功，就是因为他们束缚了自己的信念。摆脱梦想杀手：梦想杀手是你走向成功的死敌。你的朋友、同事甚至你所爱的人都可能成为你的梦想杀手。有些人将试图让你分心、扰乱你的心绪或是劝说你去过他们想要的而不是你想要的生活。不要听信那些用各种理由阻拦你，说你无法实现自己梦想的人。你只需要相信自己能做到任何想做的事。其他人只能暂时让你灰心，而能够永远激励你的人只有你自己。不要再给自己找借口:孩子常常说他们能做什么，而许多成年人正好相反。成年人总是感叹他们做不了什么，并编出各种理由。你应该停止为自己无法实现梦想而找理由。许多所谓的理由仅仅是借口。如果你继续为失败找借口的话，你很快就会使自己确信你真的无法达到你最初设定的目标。正如亨利・福特的至理名言所说：“无论你认为自己行，还是不行，你都绝对是正确的口”立即采取行动：_旦你有了伟大并且明确的梦想，马上采取行动去把它们变为现实。在大多数情况下，如果人们没有及时将计划付诸行动的话，他们的热情就会开始减弱。几周后，热情就会冷却，数月后，也许就会永远消失。请思考这个问题：5只鸟在篱笆上休息，几分钟后，3只决定飞走去寻找食物。篱笆上还剩几只鸟呢？两只？错误！篱笆上应该还有5只鸟，因为决定飞走并不等于有飞走的实际行动。只有当它们真正采取行动并且飞出他们的安乐窝，它们才能找到食物。

The universe is its temple. It unfolds into the numberless flowers of spring. It waves in the branches of trees and the green blades of grass. It haunts the depths of the earth and the sea. It gleams from the hues ofthe shell and the precious stone. And not only these minute objects but the oceans, the mountains, the clouds, the stars, the rising and the setting sun-all overfiow with beauty. This beauty is so precious, and so. congenial to our tenderest and noblest feelings, that it is ptunfuI to think of the multitude ofpeople living in the midst of it and yet remairung almost lind to it.All persons should seek to become acquainted with the beauty in nature.

During this half hour, sometime, I will try to get a better perspective of my life.Just for today I will be unafraid.

就是为了今天，我将尽力只度过今天而不立刻去解决终身的问题。对于一件如果我坚持一辈子就会令我沮丧的事，我只会坚持12个小时。就是为了今天，我会很快乐。亚伯拉罕・林肯说过，“大多数人都是决定想怎么高兴就怎么高兴。”这已经被认为是真理。就是为了今天，我会做自我调整以适应事物本来的面目，而不是想方设法使每一件事都满足自己的欲望。当机会来临的时候我会抓住它。就是为了今天，我会尽力心强志坚。我会学习学一些有用的东西。我不会做一个精神上的流浪汉。我会读一些需要努力思考和注意力集中的东西。就是为了今天，我会用3种方法来磨炼我的灵魂。我会做对某人有利的事但不能被发现，若有人发现了就不算数。我将会做至少两件我不愿做的事情――只为了磨练。我不会让任何人感到我的感情受到了伤害：它们可能受到了伤害，但今天我不想表现出来。就是为了今天，我会过得很惬意。我要让自己看上去达到最佳状态：穿着得体、讲话谦虚、行为礼貌、一点也不吹毛求疵，尽量改进和调节自己而不是别人。就是为了今天，我会制定一个计划，我也许不会去严格地遵守它，但我一定要有计划。我会避免两种错误：仓促行事和优柔寡断。就是为了今天，我将会独自静静地呆上半小时以放松自己。在这半小时里的某个时刻，我会尽力对我的生活有个更好的看法。就是为了今天，我将不再害怕。尤其是我不会再害怕享受美丽的事物，并且相信我给予世界的，世界也会给予我。

From the golden-tipped fields of mid-west America to the ancient kingdoms of verdant Palestine, there is a happy truth to be shared with all who would take heed. In more recent times, this truth has been expressed as: April showers bring May flowers. This is a truth that promises light bursting from darkness, strength born from weakness and if one dares to believe,life emerging from death.Farmers all over the world know the importance and immutability of the seasons. They know that there is a season to plant and a season to harvest; everything must be done in its own time. Although the rain pours down with the utmost relentlessness, ceasing all outdoor activities, the man of the field lifts his face to the heavens and smiles. Despite the inconvenience, he knows that the rain provides the nourishment his crops need to grow and fiourish. The torrenhal rains in the month ofApril, give rise to the glorious flowers in the month of May.But this ancient truth applies to more than the crops of the fields; it is an invaluable message of hope to all who experience tragedy in life. A dashed relationship with one can open up the door to a brand new friendship with another. A lost job here can provide the opportunity for a better job there. A broken dream can become the foundation of a wonderful future. Everything has its place.Remember this: overwhelming darkness may endure for a night but it will never overcome the radiant light of the moming. When you are in a season of sorrow, hang in there, because a season ofjoy may be just around the comer ..

The fault-finder will find faults in paradise.Love your life, poor as it is.You may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poor-house. The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the alms-house as brightly as from the rich man's abode; the snow melts efore its door as early in the spring.I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and haye as cheering thoughts, as in a palace. The town's poor seem to me often to live the most independent lives of any. May be they are simply great enough to receive without misgiving. Most think that they are above being supported by the town, but it often happens that they are not above supporting themselves by dishonest means, which should be more disreputable. Cultivate poverty like a garden herb, like sage. Do not trouble yourself much to get new things, whether clothes or friends.Tum the old, return to them. Things do not change; we change. Sell your clothes and keep your thoughts.

Life Is a Do-it-yourself ProjectAn elderly carpenter was ready to retire. He told his employer of his plans to leave the house building business and live a more leisurely life with his wife enjoying his extended family. He would miss the paycheck, but he needed to retire. They could get by.The employer was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if he could build just one more house as a personal favor. The carpenter said yes, but in time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work. He resorted to shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials. It was an unfortunate way to end his career.When the carpenter finished his work and the employer came to inspect the house and handed the front-door key to the carpenter. "This is your house," he said, "my gift to you."What a shock! What a shame! If he had only known he was building his own house: he would have done it all so differently. Now he had to live in the home he had built none too well.So it is with us. We build our lives in a distracted way, reacting rather than acting, willing to put up less than the best. At important points we do not give thejob our best effort. Then with a shock we look at the situation we have created and find that we are now living in the house we have built.If we had realized, we would have done it differently.Think of yourself as the carpenter. Think about your house. Each day you hammer a nail, place a board, or erect a wall. Build wisely. It is the only life you will ever build. Even if you live it for only one day more, that day deserves to be lived graciously and with dignity. The plaque on the wall says, "Life is a do-it-yourself project." Who could say it more clearly? Your life tomorrow will be the result of your attitudes and the choices you make today.

Relish the MomentTucked away in our subconscious is an idyllic vision. We see ourselves on a long trip that spans the continent. We are traveling by train.Out the windows, we druk in the passing scene of cars on nearby highways, of children waving at a crossing, of cattle grazing on a distant hillside, of smoke pouring from a power plant, of row upon row of corn and wheat, of flatlands and valleys, of mountains and rolling hillsides, of city skylines and village halls.But upper most in our minds is the final destination. On a certain day at a certain hour, we will pull into the station. Bands will be playing and flags waving.Once we get there, so many wonderful dreams will come true and the pieces of our lives will fit together like a completed saw puzzle. How restlessly we pace the aisles, cursing the mmutes for loitering-waiting, waiting, waiting for the station."When we reach the station, that will be it!" we cry. "When I'm 18.""When I buy a new 450SL Mercedes Benz!" "When I put the last kid though college." "When I have paid off the mortgage!" "When I get a promble.""When I reach the age of retirement, I shall live happily ever after! "Sooner or later, we must realize there is no station, no one place to arrive at once and for all. The true joy of life is the trip. The station is only a dream. It constantly outdistances us. "Relish the moment" is a good motto, especially when coupled with Psalm 118-24- "This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it," It isn't the burdens of today that drive men mad. It is the regrets over yesterday and the fear oftomorrow. Regret and fear are twin thieves who rob us of today.So stop pacing the aisles and counting the miles.Instead, climb more mountains, eat more ice cream, go barefoot more often, swim more rivers, watch more sunsets, laugh more, cry less. Life must be lived as we go along. The station will come soon enough.

Happiness is like a stone dropped into a pool to set in motion an every widening, circle of ripples. As Stevenson has said, "being happy is a duty."There is no exact definition of the word happiness. Happy people are happy for all sorts of reasons. The key is not wealth or physical well-being, since we find beggars, patients and so-called failures who are extremely happy.Being happy is a sort of unexpected dividend. But staying happy is an accomplishment, a triumph of soul and character; it is not selfish to struggle for it. It is indeed, a duty to ourselves and others.Being unhappy is like an infectious disease; it causes people to shrink away from the sufferer. He soon frnds himself alone, miserable and embittered.There is, however, a cure so simple as to seem, at first glance, ridiculous: If you don't feel happy, pretend to be!It works. Before long you will that instead of repelling people, you attract them, You discover how deeply rewarding it is to be the center of wider and wider circles of good will.Then the make-believe becomes a realityr. You possess the secret of peace of mind and can forget yourself in being of service to others,Being happy once it is realized as a duty and established as a habit opens doors into unimaginable gardens thronged with grateful friends.

No young man believes he shall ever die. It was a saying of my brother's, and a fine one. There is a feeling of Eternity in youth, which makes us amend for everything. To be young is to be as one of the Immortal Gods. One half of time indeed is flown, the other half remains in store for us with all its countless treasures, and we see no limit to our hopes and wishes. We make the coming age our own.The vast, the unbounded prospect lies before us. Death, old age are words without a meaning that pass by us like the idea air which we regard not. Others may have undergone, or may still be liable to them-we "bear a charmed life", which laughs to scom all such sickly fancies. As in setting out on delightful journey，we strain our eager gaze forward. Bidding the lovely scenes at distance hail! And see no end to the landscape, new objects presenting themselves as we advance, so, in the commencement of life, we set no bounds to our inclinations, nor to the unrestricted opportunities of gratifying them. we have as yet found no obstacle, no disposition to flag; and it seems that we can go on so forever. We look round in a new world, full of life, and motion, and ceaseless progress; and feel in ourselves aU the vigor and spirit to keep pace with it, and do not foresee from any present symptoms how we shall be left behind in the natural course of things, decline into old age, and drop into the grave.It is the simplicity, and as it were abstractedness of our feelings in youth, that (so to speak) identifies us with nature, and (our experience being slight and our passions strong) deludes us into a belief of being immortal like it. Our short-lives connection with existence we fondly flatter ourselves, is an indissoluble and lasting union-a honeymoon that knows neither coldness, jar, nor separation. As infants smile and sleep, we are rocked in the cradle of our wayward fancies, and lulled into security by the roar ofthe ruuverse around us.We quaff the cup oflife with eager haste without draining it, instead ofwhich it only overflows, the more objects press around us, filling the mind with their magnitude and with the strong of desires that wait upon them, so that we have no room for the thoughts of death.

To a large degree, the measure of our peace of mind is determined by how much we are able to live in the present moment.lrrespective of what happened yesterday or last year, and what may or may not happen tomorrow, the present moment is where you are -always.Without question, many of us have mastered the neurotic art of spending much of our lives worrying about a variety of things all at once.We allow past problems and future concems to dominate our present moments, so much so that we end up anxious, frustrated, depressed, and hopeless. On the flip side, we also postpone our gratification, our stated priorities, and our happiness, often convincing ourselves that"someday"will be better than today, Unfortunately, the same mental dynamics that tell us to look toward the future will only repeat themselves so that¨someday" never actually arrives. John Lennon once said: "Life is what's happening while we're busy making other plans." When we're busy making“other plans", our children are busy growing up, the people we love are moving away and dying, our bodies are getting out of shape, and our dreams are slipping away Inshort, we miss out our life.Many people live as if life were a dress rehearsal for some later date. It isn't. In fact, no one has a guarantee that he or she will be here tomorrow. Now is the only time we have, and the only time that we have any control over. When our attention is in the present moment, we push fear from our minds. Fear is the concem over events that might happen in the future -we won' t have enough money, our children will get into trouble, we will get old and die, whatever.To combat fear, the best strategy is to learn to bring your attention back to the present: Mark Twain said, "I have been through some terrible tlungs in my life, some of which actually happened." I don't think I can say it any better, Practice keeping your attention on the here and now. Your effortswill pay great dividends.

Today I Begin a New LifeToday I shed my old skin which has, too long, suffered the bruises of failure and the wounds ofmediority,Today I am born anew and my birthplace is a vineyard where there is fruit for all.Today I will pluck grapes of wisdom from the tallest and fullest vines in the vineyard, for these were planted by the wisest of my profession who have come before me, generation upon generation.Today I will savor the taste of grapes frornthese vines and verily I will swallow the seed ofsuccess buried in each and new life will sprout within me.The career I have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught with heart break and despair and the bodies of those who have failed, were they piled one atop another, would cast a shadow down upon all the pyramids of the earth.Yet I will not fail, as the others, for in my hands I now hold the charts which will guide through perilous waters to shores which only yesterday seemed but a dream.Failure no longer will be my payment for struggle. Just as nature made no provision for my body to tolerate pain neither has it made any provision for my life to suffer failure. Failure, like pain, is alien to my life. In the past I accqpted it as I accepted pain. Now I reject it and I am prepared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the shadows into the sunlight of wealth, position, and happiness far beyond my most extravagant dreams. Time teaches aU things to him who lives forever but I have not the luxury of etemity. Yet within my allotted time I must prachce the art of patience for nature acts never in haste. To create the olive, king ofall trees, a hundred years is required. An onion plant is old in nine weeks. I have lived as an onion plant. It has not pleased me, Now I would become the geatest of olive trees and, in truth, the greatest of salesman.And how will this be accomplished? For I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to achieve the greatness and already I have stumbled ignorance and fallen into pools of self-pity. The answer is simple. I will commence my journey unencumbered with either the weight of unnecessary knowledge or the handicap of meaningless experience. Nature already has supplied me with knowledge and instinct far greater than any beast in the forest and the value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidly.In truth, experience teaches thoroughly yet her course ofinstruction devours men's years so the value of her lessons diminishes with the time necessar}r to acquire her special wisdom. The end finds it wasted on dead men. Furthermore, experience is comparable to fashion; an action that proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrow.Only principles endure and these I now possess, for the laws that will lead me to greatnesss are contained in the words of these scroUs. What they will teach me is more to prevent failure than to gain success, for what is success other than a state of mind? Which two, among a thousand wise men, will define success in the same words; yet failure is always described but oneway. Failure is man's inability to reach his goals in life, whatever they may be.In truth,the difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the fust law I will obey, which precedeth aU others is-l will form good habits and become their slave.As a child I was slave to my impulses; now I am slave to my habits,as are all grown men. I have surrendered my free will to the years of accumulated habits and the past deeds of my life have already markedout a path which threatens to imprison my future . My actions are ruled by appetite, passion, prejudice, greed, love, fear, environment, habit, and the worst ofthese tyrants is habit. Therefore, ifl must be a slave to habit let me be a slave to good habits. My bad habits must be destroyed and new furrows prepared for good seed.I will form good habits and become their slave.And how will Iaccomplish this difficult feat? Through these scrolls, it will be done, for each scroll contains a principle which will drive a bad habit from my life and replace it with one which will bring me closer to success. For it is another ofnature's laws that only a habit can subdue another habit So, in order for these written words to perform their chosen task, I must discipline myselfwith the first ofmy new habits which is as follows:I will read each scroll for tlurty days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll. First, I will read the words in silence when I arise. Then, I will read the words in silence after I have partaken of my midday meal. Last, I will read the words again just before I retire at day's end, and most important, on this occasion I will read the words aloud.On the next day I will repeat this procedure, and I will continue in that manner for thirty days. Then, I will tum to the next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thirty days, I will continue in this manner until I have lived with each scroll for thirty days and my reading has become habitAnd what will be accomplished with this habit? Herein lies the hidden secret of all man's accomplishments.As I repeat the wordsdaily they will soon become a part of my active mind, but more important, they will also seep into my other mind, that mysterious source which never sleeps which creates my dreams, and often makes me act in ways I do not comprehend.As the words of these scrolls are consumed by my mysterious mind I will begin to awake, each moming, with a vitality I have never known before. My vigor will increase, my enthusiasm will rise, my desire to meet the world will overcome every fear I once knew at sunrise, and I will be happier than I ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow.Eventually I will find myself reacting to all situations which confront me as I was commanded in the scrolls to. react, and soon
these actions and reactions will become easy to perform, for any act with practice becomes easy.Thus a new and good habit is bom, for when an act becomes easy throug,h constant repetiton it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is man's nature to perform it often. When I perform it often it becomes a habit and I become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my will.Today I begin a new life.And I make a solemn oath to myselfthat nothing will retard my new life's growth. I will lose not a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieved nor can I substitute another for it. I must not , I will not, break this habit of daily reading from these scrolls and, in truth, the few moments spent each day on this new habit are but a small price to pay for the happiness and success that will be mine.As I read and re-read the words in the scrolls to follow, never will I allow the brevity of each scroll nor the simplicity ofits words to cause me to treat the scroll9s message lightly. Th. ousands of grapes are pressed to fill one jar with wine, and the grape skin and pulp are tossed to the birds. So it is with these grapes of wisdom from the ages. Much has been filtered and tossed to the wind. Only the pure truth lies disfilled in the words to come. I will drink as instructed and spill not a drop. And the seed of success I will swallow.Today my old slan has become as dust. I will walk tall among men and they will know me not, for today I am a new man, with a new life.

今天我将开始新的生活今天，我爬出满是失败创伤的老茧。今天，我重新来到这个世上，我出生在葡萄园中，园内的葡萄任人享用。今天，我要从最高最密的藤上摘下智慧的果实，这葡萄藤是好几代前的智者种下的。今天，我要品尝葡萄的美味，还要吞下每一位成功的种子，让新生命在我心里萌芽。我选择的道路充满机遇，也有辛酸与绝望，失败的同伴数不胜数，叠在一起，投下的阴影比世界上任何的金字塔还高。然而，我不会像他们一样失败，因为我手中持有航海图，它可以指引我越过汹涌的大海，抵达梦中的彼岸失败不再是我奋斗的代价。正如天性不允许我的身体容忍疼痛一样，也不允许我遭受失败。如同疼痛，它们和我，就像水火一样，互不相容。我不再像过去一样接受它们。我要在智慧的指引下，走出失败的阴影，步入富足、健康、快乐的乐园，这些都超出了我以往的梦想。我要是能长生不老，就可以学到一切，但我不能永生，所以，在有限的人生里，我必须学会忍耐的艺术，因为大自然的行为一向是从容不迫的。造物主创造树中之王――橄榄树需要一百年的时间，而洋葱经过短短的9个星期就会枯老。我经历过洋葱式的生活，那种生活并不能使我满足。我要成为万树之王――橄榄树，成为现实生活中最伟大的推销员。怎么可能？我既没有渊博的知识，又没有丰富的经验，况且，我曾一度跌人愚昧与自怜的深渊。答案很简单。我不会让所谓的知识或者无谓的经验妨碍我的行程。造物主已经赐予了我足够的知识和本能，这份天赋是其他生物所望尘莫及的。经验的价值往往被高估了，人老的时候开口讲的多是糊涂话。说实在的，经验确实能教给我们很多东西，只是这需要花费太长的时间。等到人们获得智慧的时候，其价值已随着时间的消逝而减少了。结果往往是这样，经验丰富了’人也余生无多。经验好比时尚，适合于今天的行为，并不意味着在明天仍然行得通。只有原则是持久的，而我现在正拥有了这些原则。这些可以指引我走向成功的原则全写在这几张羊皮卷里。它们教我更多的是如何避免失败，而不只是获得成功，因为成功更是一种精神状态。人们对于成功的定义，是仁者见仁，智者见智，而失败却往往只有一种解释：失败就是一个人没能达到他的人生目标，不论这些目标是什么。事实上，成功者与失败者毛利的最大差异，在于各自不同的习惯。好习惯是开启成功的钥匙，坏习惯则是一扇向失败敞开的门。因此，我首先要做的便是养成良好的习惯，全心全意去实行。小时候，我经常会感情用事，长大成人了，我要用良好的习惯代替一时的冲动。我的自由意志屈服于多年养成的恶习，它们威胁着我的前途。我的行为受到品味、情感、偏见、欲望、爱、恐惧、环境和习惯的影响，其中最厉害的就是习惯。因此，如果我必须受习惯支配的话，那就让我受好习惯的支配。那些坏习惯必须戒除，我要在新的田地里播种好的种子。我要养成良好的习惯，全心全意去实行。这不是轻而易举的事情，要怎样才能做到呢？靠这些羊皮卷就能做到。因为每一卷里都写着一个原则，可以摒除一项坏习惯，换取一个好习惯，使人进步，走向成功。这也是自然法则之．，只有一种习惯才能抑制另一种习惯。所以，为了走好我选择的道路，我必须养成的第一个习惯是：每张羊皮卷用30天的时间阅读，然后再进人下一 卷。清晨即起，默默诵读，午饭之后，再次默读，夜晚睡前，高声朗读。第二天的情形完全一样。这样重复30天后，就可以打开下一卷了o每一卷都依照同样的方法读上3 0天，久而久之，它们就成为一种习惯了。这些习惯有什么好处呢？这里隐含着人类成功的秘诀。当我每天重复这些话的时候，它们组成了我精神活动的一部分，更重要的是，它们渗入到我的心灵。在这个神秘的世界里，它们永不静止，创造梦境，并在不知不觉中影响我的行为。当这些羊皮卷上的文字，被我奇妙的心灵完全吸收之后，我每天都会充满活力地醒来。我从来没有这样精力充沛过。我更有活力、更有热情，要向世界挑战的欲望克服了-一切恐惧与不安。在这个充满争斗和悲伤的世界里，我竟然比以前更快活。最后，我会发现自己从羊皮卷上学来了应付一切情况的办法。不久，这些办法就能运用自如。因为，任何方法，只要多练习，就会变得简单易行。经过多次重复，一种看似复杂的行为就变得轻而易举，实行起来，就会有无限的乐趣，有了乐趣，出于人之天性，我就更乐意常去实行。于是，一种好的习惯便诞生了’习惯又成为自然。既是一种好的习惯，它也就成为了我的意愿。今天，我开始新的生活。我郑重地发誓，绝不让任何事情妨碍我新生命的成长。在阅读这些羊皮卷的时候，我绝不浪费一天的时间，因为时光一去不返，失去的日子是无法弥补的。我也绝不打破每天阅读的习惯。事实上，每天在这些新习惯上所花费的少许时间，相对于可能获得的愉乐与成功而言，只是微不足道的代价。当我反复阅读羊皮卷中的字句时，我绝不能让自己因为文字的精炼而忽视内容的深沉。一瓶葡萄美酒需要千百颗果子酿制而成，果皮和渣子被抛给小鸟。葡萄的智慧代代相传，有些被过滤，有些被淘汰，随风飘逝。只有纯正的真理才是永恒的。它们就精炼在我要阅读的文字中。我要依照指示，饮下成功的种子，绝不浪费一滴。今天，我的老茧化为尘埃。我在人群中昂首阔步，不会有人认出我来，因为我不再是过去的自己、我已拥有新的生命。

The Life I DesiredThat must be the story of innumerable couples, and the pattern of life it offers has a homely grace.It reminds you ofa placid rivulet, meandering smoothly through green pastures and shaded by pleasant trees, till at last it falls into the vast sea, but the sea is so calm, so silent, so indiflerent, that you are.troubled suddenly by a vague uneasiness. Perhaps it is only by a kink in my nature, strong in me even in those days, that I felt in such an existence, the share ofthe great majority , something anuss.I recognized its social value. I saw its ordered happiness, but a fever in my blood asked for a wilder course. There seemed to me something alarming in such easy delights. In my heart was desire to live more dangerously. I was not unprepared for jagged rocks and treacherous shoals ifl could only have change and the excitement of unforeseen.

我所追求的生活这一定是世间无数对夫妻的生活写照，这种生活模式给人一种天伦之美。它使人想起一条平静的溪流，蜿蜒畅游过绿茵的草场，一路被浓荫遮蔽，最后注入烟波浩渺的汪洋大海；但是大海太过平静，太过沉默，太过不动声色，你会突然感到莫名的不安。也许这只是我自己的一种怪诞想法，在那样的时代，这想法对我影响很深：我觉得这像大多数人一样的生活，似乎欠缺了一点儿什么。我承认这种生活有社会价值，我也看到了它那井然有序的幸福，但我血液里的冲动却渴望一种更桀骜不驯的旅程。这样的安逸中好像有一种叫我惊惧不安的东西，我的心渴望一种更加惊险的生活。只要生活中还能有变迁以及不可知的刺激，我愿意踏上怪石嶙峋的山崖，奔赴暗礁满布的海滩。

The subtle bitter is what it is meant to be...I like the subtle endship that does not hold people together.

Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearablepity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, haveblown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a deep ocean ofanguish, reaching to the verge of despair.I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would have sacrificed all the rest oflife for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness - that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the run of the world into cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it, finally, because in the union oflove I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what-at last-l have found,With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men, I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds away above the flux. A little of this, but not much, l have achieved.Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth.Echoes of cries of pain reverberated in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and the whole world ofloneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery ofwhat human life should be. I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.This has been my life. I have found it worth living,and I would gladly live it again ifthe chance were offered to me.

3种简单却极其强烈的情感主宰着我的生活：对爱的渴望、对知识的追求、对人类痛苦的难以承受的怜悯之心。这3种情感，像一阵阵飓风―样，任意地将我吹的飘来荡去，越过痛苦的海洋，抵达绝望的彼岸。我寻找爱，首先，因为它令人心醉神迷，这种沉醉是如此美妙，以至于我愿意用余生来换取那几个小时的快乐。我寻找爱，其次是因为它会减轻孤独，―旦置身于那种可怕的孤独之中，你那颤抖的灵魂就会处在世界的边缘，而你所看到的也只是冰冷的、死寂的、无底深渊。我寻找爱，还因为在真爱交融之时，在一个神秘的缩影中，我见到了先贤和诗人们所想象的、预览的天堂。这就是我所追求的，尽管对于凡人来说，这好像是一种奢望。但这是我最终找到的。我曾以同样的热情来追求知识。我希望能理解人类的心灵，希望能知道为什么星星会发光。我也曾经努力理解毕达哥拉斯学派的理论，他们认为数字主载着万物的此消彼长。我了解了一点知识，但是不多.爱和知识，可以最大可能地将人带入天堂。可是，怜悯总是将我带回地面。人们因痛苦而发出的哭声在我心中久久回响，那些饥荒中的孩子们、被压迫者摧残的受害者们、被子女视为可憎负担的、无助的老人侗，以及那无处不在的孤单、贫穷和痛苦都在讽刺着人类所本应该拥有的生活。我渴望能够消除人世间的邪恶，可是力不从心，我自己也同样遭受着它们的折磨。这就是我的生活。我觉得活一场是值得的。如果给我机会的话，我愿意开心地再活一次。

Today, look at the blue sky, hear the grass growing beneath your feet, inhale the scent of spring, let the fruits of the earth linger on your tongue, reach out and embrace those you love. Ask Spirit to awaken your awareness to the sacredness ofyour sensory perceptions.What a nuracle it is.No matter how long. the winter, how hard the frost or how deep the snow, Nature triumphs. No season is awaited so eagerly or welcomed so warmly as spring...Each year I am astonished by the wealth of flowers the season gives us: the subtlety of the wild primroses and violets, the rich palette of crocus in the parks, tall tulips and proud trumpeting daffodils.Picture this: The air and the earth interpenetrated in the warm gusts of spring; the soil was full of sunlight, and the sunlight full of red dust. The air one breathed was saturated with earthy smells, and the grass under foot had a reflection ofblue sky in it.Every spring is the only spring, a perpetual astonishment.In those vernal seasons ofthe year, when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an injury and sullenness against Nature not to go out and see her riches, and part.ake in her rejoicing with heaven and earth.

今天，仰望蓝天，聆听小草在脚下生长，呼吸春天的气息，细细品尝大地的果实，然后放开双手拥抱你的所爱。让上帝唤醒你那神圣的知觉。这真是一个奇迹无论冬天多么漫长，无论霜雪多么严寒，自然总能获胜。没有哪个季节像春天那么让人翘首企盼……每年春花的烂漫总让我惊讶不已：野生报春花和紫罗兰的娇嫩，公园里藏红花的多彩，还有高大的郁金香和傲然的水仙花。想象这样一幅图景：温暖的春风弥漫着泥土的气息，阳光照射着每一寸土壤，土壤把阳光染成深红色。空气中渗透着泥土的清香，脚下的小草与头上的蓝天遥相呼应。每个春天都是独一无二的，是自然界永恒的奇迹。在春天这个季节里，当天朗气清的时候,如果不到室外理赏大自然的丰饶，并分享天地的喜悦，就是对它的一种伤害和亵渎。

I like to joke that I am who I am today because I did everything wrong in my 20's. I've always been fearless, and it often got me in trouble. I wasn't afraid to start a business, borrow a bunch of money, or quit a well-paying job to travel the world.At the same time, the fact that I took chances (and often failed) gave me the wisdom that I have today. Lessons leamed througb failure tend to be much more meaningful than lessons leamed otherwise.Now that I'm in my 30's, life is pretty good, While I haven't learned it all, I feel my head is screwed on straight enough that life is much less stressful 。 I've come into my own and built the foundation for a secure and prosperous future.Even though things are going well, I often imagine what it would be like to go back into the past and teach myself what I know now. I know enough to be certain that I lost most of my twenties to a struggle with debt and poor decisions. If I had done things differently, maybe I could have been where I am now at age 22,Could you imagine? Self employed and almost finacianciall independent at age 22? No... not almost. My expenses were much less back then... I would have been financially freefI know, it doesn't do any good to ask what if. If I had known it all at age 22: I probably would have been a little cocky. Doing things the hard way seasoned my character. I like who I am and I wouldn't change a thing.But what if...What I'd Tell Myself at 18?Sometimes I imagine that I'm in a fishing boat, thousands of miles away from the life I know, slowly drifting across a lake: As I recline at an uncomfortable angle created by the wood bench, I glance over at the 18 year-old version of myself and upload my wisdom to him.

我常开玩笑说，我之所以是现在的我，完全是因为我20几岁时把一切事情都做错，那个时候，我什么都不怕，所以经常惹麻烦。我不怕为了创业而借一屁股的债，又或者是辞去高薪的工作只是为了周游世界。也正因为那时候的我抓住了很多机会（虽然经常以失败告终），才让今天的我学到了许多智慧。相比较之下，从失败中吸取的教训比从其他地方学到的东西更加深刻。现在，我过着幸福的30岁生活。尽管我还没有掌握到生活的全部，但是我觉得已经足以让自己的生活不太有压力。我有着自己的生活方式，并且给未来打下了安全、繁荣的基础。尽管一切都在顺利地进行，我还是经常想象，如果我回到过去并且把我现在学到的东西教给那个时候的我，事情会变成什么样子。我非常清楚，20几岁的我大部分时间都在和债务以及自己的糟糕决定纠缠。 如果我能用另外一种方式去做事，也许在我22岁的时候就能有今天的成就。你能够想象在22岁的时候就自己当老板并且财政独立吗？不，不可想象啊。我那时的花费非常的低，说不定那时我就可以财政自由了！我也知道说“如果……”是没有什么意义的。 如果我在22岁的时候就能知道这些了，我可能会变得有些骄傲自大。困难让我成长。我喜欢现在的我，我不打算去改变什么。但是如果……如果我回到18岁我会告诉我自己什么呢？有时候我会想象我在一艘渔船上，离真实的生活千里之遥，慢慢地在湖中漂荡。我不太舒服地躺在木凳上，瞥一眼18岁的自己，然后把自己现在的智慧传给他。
